It depends were your sore.If your body is sore like your muscles, then it will probably go away, it's just like you had a big extensive workout. However, if it's internal pain, you should try and see your doctor, cuz maybe something is wrong :(
don't run, the compression will make it worse- and if you opt for surgery(try not to) you may never run normally again. to work the same muscles, if you are training for an event- try biking and most defninietely use the eliptoglider (that skiing/ arm thing) that sucker is non impact and will keep your thighs and calves ultimately powerful!!!\nRock on, marathon man!!\nTry to cross-train by doing some laps- swimmers are some tough characters!

Where are you using the circuit breaker ?\nin a house panel the circuit breaker is max sized by the wire and mim sized by the load at 100%. Unless the load is a motor then the c/b is oversized 115% or 125%. the reason is the starting current of the motor and if it has a 60 or 90 C rating.

I have noticed that there is not as much sperm if i do it like once a day. It needs time to be replentished. try and go every other day.
go to a doctor cause you may need your thyroid checked. all they do is simple blood test. it's not that painfull. also your doctor may need to check your hormones if they are sightly out of wack this could be causing unwanted hair growth. so ask your doctor about it first. they should be able to tell you safe ways to take care of your problem. and if it's medical they can help you there. don't try home remidies without checking with your doctor cause you could have an allergic reaction. anyway, good luck. i hope i could have been of help to you.
Is he in Arizona?\n\nUsually somebody has to be a resident. If you move somewhere else, you're no longer a resident.\n\nAre there children involved or property? \n\nYou need to ask an attorney. I'm going to guess the answer will be "no", if neither of you are residents of the state. However, I could be wrong.
You really want to live in western Iowa?? :) Just kidding. I'd start by googling for all the realty firms in bigger towns. Call them and tell them exactly what you just said. Many times realtors won't advertise old or abandoned places because of the cost of the newspaper ads. But there's always one somewhere in the back of their file that they never thought they'd sell. Good luck!
First of all I'm sorry for your loss. If he had wanted to share this information with you he would have told you his ID. My family and I know each others ID and frequently watch each other get on this site. Remember him the way you knew him. You may be disappointed in some of the stuff he asked or answered here. Some of this stuff is so dirty and you would not want to remember him as visiting those questions to answer if he did. Not saying he did but you never know. Just love him for what you know of him and remember him with fondness. God bless you for the love you have for your brother.

If you work for her then what you make is legally hers unless you have a contract stating otherwise. Remember you're not making the idea as yourself, but as an employee. \n\nIt sounds like you want her to take the risk, but then you profit if it works. I'm sorry but I don't think that's right. If you came up with an idea and tried it out on your own and not at someone elses bakery I'd feel that you should profit from it. \n\nBottom line is if you're not the one willing to take the risk then you shouldn't be the one to profit. Unless she's willing to allow you to keep your products then I'd find another way to produce them. Open your own business and find bakeries willing to be sold "use" rights for your tort, etc In this way you don't need to be making them and you clearly own the rights to the recipe. You could then even offer to "consult" with the employees on how to actually cook them, etc.

No, you don't need a degree but you must be aware of the tools and techniques needed to fabricate things. Many of the great inventors did not even have a formal education but they had hands on experience in makng things.
Peace in this world is not a matter of everyone believing the same things. It's a matter of accepting the fact that everyone thinks differently, and not trying to prove who is right and who is wrong. The reason why there is not peace in the world today, is because there are too many people who can't accept the differences of others.

I am fascinated by spirits. I have had personal experiences with them. One of my favorite things to do is go cemetery hopping at night! I take pics trying to find orbs or mists. I also enjoy staying in "haunted hotels". I stayed in a bed and breakfast in st. Louis mo called Lemp Masion. It had been listed as the second most haunted place in the country. It was awesome!! Put it this way, I asked my husband before we got there, if he believed in ghosts. He said "I believe in exterrestials before ghosts!" He didn't say that the next morning! He said "There were too many things happening you can't explain." I don't know how close you are to st. louis, but it's worth the trip. Go to www.lempmansion.com

Wow. You would think a "cheeky" question would generate more answers. I grew up in the USA, so I'm not even positive what "cheeky" is. \n\nSelf confidence is a different matter. I suppose any number of self-help books and techniques could help you there.\n\nBut I think first of all, you need to be yourself. That way you will attract friends who like you. If you act cheeky and self confident, and feel otherwise, you will attract people you would rather not spend time with.\n\nHowever, that wasn't your question. \n\nOkay, I just looked up cheeky: Impertinently bold; impudent and saucy. I would say read cheeky material, hang out with cheeky friends, and it's bound to rub off. \n\nAs for self confident: showing poise and confidence in your own worth...it doesn't seem to be a synonym for cheeky. \n\nCheeky seems to hinge on a disregard for accepted measurements of society. Self confidence seems to require an understanding of accepted forms of evaluating an individual.\n\nPerhaps you could be a poised, polite, person...who is bold (cheeky) about facing life's hardships, but humble and self confident, when dealing with relationships.\n\n...you know, someone who faces life sarcastically, but treats people with serious consideration...\n\nNow that sounds like someone I could be friends with.

If you were to reduce your calorie intake by 100 calories a day you could lose weight. For example you swap a coke a day with water. There are various reasons why people lose weight. Some include sickness, stress, worms even. Some explained and others can't be. If you aren't sleeping enough that can also assist with weight loss. So the answer is yes, a person can lose weight without even trying.

But would local power-holders allow it?

Two, actually- One was a simple water heater for a cabin of mine, using a rooftop black insulated tub with a large clear cover-the sun heated the water, and I was able to take a warm shower at night- The other was a triple paned greenhouse made out of 3mm plastic- It was an experiment I did to see how long I could keep a greenhouse going in the winter here in Manitoba. The cost of either was negligible.

Only 2% of cases of congenital hypothyroidism are hereditary, so it is unlikely that your grandchildren will have any problems.

Carbon is a vital component of all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist. The major economic use of carbon is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuels methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is used by the petrochemical industry to produce, amongst others, gasoline and kerosene, through a distillation process, in refineries. Crude oil forms the raw material for many synthetic substances, many of which are collectively called plastics.\n\nReally, visit Wikipedia...most of the info there is pretty sound.

In the Marine Corps your promotion to E4 and E5 is based on your composite score and your MOS's cutting score. Your composite score is based on your pro's and con's and your PFT score and rifle score. They also give you points for how long you've been in and how long you've been at the rank you are. To get promoted to E6 you have to have been an E5 for at least 2 years before you are eligible to pick up (unless it is a field (combat) promotion)then it is up to recommendations from your SNCO's and up. They don't have NCO school they have CPL's Course and SGT's Course some MOS's require you to go some recommend you go and some could care less if you go or not.

i don't really know about any of the other things u asked but i can tell u about angels and demons. Angels are God's messangers and the people that inhabit heaven. like us they have free will also. God created angels when he decided to create heaven. Demons and Hell didn't exist until one of the angels decided to sin. he decided that he wuz better than God and that he wuz more fit to be king than God wuz. i don't know if i explained that rite, but bascially he wuz jealous. then God cast him out of heaven and everyone that decided to go with him. thats when hell wuz created. the angel became Satan and his fellowers became demons.

Radioactive waste is waste material containing radioactive chemical elements that does not have a practical purpose. It is sometimes the product of a nuclear process, such as nuclear fission. The majority of radioactive waste in mass and volume terms is low level waste which is often items such as used protective clothing which is only slightly contaminated.\n \n \n\n\n\nNORM (naturally occurring radioactive material)\nProcessing of substances containing natural radioactivity, this is often known as NORM. Much of this waste is alpha particles emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium.\n\n\nCoal contains a small amount of radioactive nuclides, such as uranium and thorium, but it is less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust. They become more concentrated in the fly ash because they do not burn well [1]. However, the radioactivity of fly ash is still very low. It is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled.[2].\n\n\nOil and gas\nResidues from the oil and gas industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulphate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, oil and gas from a well often contains radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where propane is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point as propane.[3]\n\nMineral processing\nWastes from mineral processing can contain natural radioactivity.\n\n\nMedical\nRadioactive medical waste tends to contain beta ray and gamma ray emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as 99mTc are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal trash. :\n\n\n\nIndustrial\nIndustrial source waste can contain alpha, beta, neutron or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in radiography while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as oil well logging.[4]\n\nNuclear fuel cycle\nAn overview of waste from the nuclear fuel cycle was written by B.V. Babu and S. Karthik, Energy Education Science and Technology, 2005, 14, 93-102.\n\n\nFront end\nWaste from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle is usually alpha emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.\n\nUranium dioxide (UO2) concentrate from mining is not very radioactive - only a thousand or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellow cake (U3O8), then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment to increase the 235U content from 0.7% to about 3.5% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.\n\nThe main by-product of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the 238U isotope, with a 235U content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable, such as the keels of yachts, and anti-tank shells. It is also used (with recycled plutonium) for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel. This dilution, also called downblending, means that any nation or group that acquired the finished fuel would have to repeat the (very expensive and complex) enrichment process before assembling a weapon.\n\n\nThe back end of the of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent fuel rods, often contains fission products that emit beta and gamma radiation, and may contain actinides that emit alpha particles, such as 234U, 237Np, 238Pu and 241Am, and even sometimes some neutron

CEO's performance is evaluated on a couple different things.\n1. The overall performance of the company.\n2. Their performance in managing the current situation of the company. \n\n1. The overall performance of the company is more important if, company is operating correctly and profitably in they eyes of the board and powerful shareholders before the CEO took it over.\n2. Their performance in managing the current situation is typically more important if the company has operational problems and has been performing poorly in their marketplace before the CEO took it over. However once a CEO has made improvements, the board and stock holders use this new improved situation of the company as the next base to gage future performance. Hence the short life of many CEO's. \n\nAre CEOs overpaid?\nNo and yes. Some are, many are not. Many "average" people believe so because of all of the recent stories regarding bad CEO's. However, salary in a capitalistic society such as the USA's, is generally based on the value of the return of the position and what that particular person brings to that position, as well as the wealth of the company or organization to pay for that position. Therefore as a CEO of a company, their "value" is extremely high and correspondingly must be paid for. \n Many people are upset at CEO's salary, however this is a function of the market economy in the society. Many think CEO's salary should be less, but this would be contrary to the capitilistic market and would create ineffectual CEO's. It would lesson the incentive to bring out the best to pursue the CEO position and as a result all positions in a company would be weakened and the company would fail. Much like many organizations in so called Communist countries fail as their is no "reward" for being good - so why be good, why try - basic human nature. If you work really hard, or are "better" than the rest but receive no reward you will not work hard at that task, but instead put your efforts elsewhere where you can achieve "reward".\n\nFinally there are many CEO's as individuals who are definitely overpaid. Typically this is the result from knowing wealthy indviduals in positions of influence who do not have the expertise to judge if a person would be a good CEO or not, who place them in the position and pay them a ridculous salary.
Muslims say that they believe the Bible, but they do not. In fact, they deny that Christ was actually crucified. They refer to him as a prophet because to recognize him as the Son of God would completely invalidate their religion, certainly the Quran.\n\nI have friends who are Muslim and I can tell you they do not study the Bible. They only study the Quran, so they only know and believe its teachings.

Cell phone is short for cellular phone. Cellular refers to the technology used. Also, a mobile phone can almost be considered as just about any phone that can leave a base and does not have a cord.\n\nAs quoted from source: \n\n"Term used currently in the United States and Canada (and in other countries as well during the 1980s) to refer to most mobile phones. It technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network. In developing mobile phone technology, American electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next. After the name "cell" was applied to the zone covered by each antenna, it was a natural choice for them to apply the term "cellular" to both the technology and the phones that ran on it."

Official answer: Earth! Why? Because it provides life, and some of it is amazingly beautiful.\n\nBut, if we were to go with planets other than earth, I'd say Jupiter and Saturn, because they're gorgeous. Jupiter has a stunning array of colors, and the thought that it's all one big violent storm just amazes me. Saturn, of course, has its phenomenal rings.\n\nOh! And if we're talking moons, then I'd say either Io (which is basically a huge mass of volcanoes; some of which are the size of Colorado!), and Europa, because beneath its icy surface may be an ocean which supports life.
first of all you need to find some available land, or get alot of weapons to take land from somewhere else. then you would need to find a way to get subjects, or citizens. then you would need to create an economy wether it be agriculture or industry. and then you would need a parlement or congress to make sure that you dont go hitler or something. thats about it, oh yeah and you need to collect taxes to fund your government and raise them incrementally to give yourself a raise every once and a while.
i find myself in an ideal position to answer this question.\n\nRecently me and my girlfriend had split up. We had been having sex while dating and now since we've broken up, we've decided that as long as we're single, we should enjoy the occasional sex (which is becoming more and more frequent). Most people will tell yo that to have sex you must be committed and it should be for love blah blah blah... \nI say this, if you both enjoy it and you both understand the rules, WHY NOT?
I have severe eczema, too. I've gotten cremes, so it sometimes lessens the rashes/hives... there isn't a real cure for it. If you don't want to see a skin doctor for prescribed creme, you can use Neosporin creme.
Perhaps you should remind him that Christianity is a religion of love, and by rejecting all these things, he is instead spreading a message of hatred and intolerance. Also, remember that story of the good Samaritan? Well, the Samaritans were Pagan

They come here to seek a better life, that much I don't doubt. However, that doesn't make it right. I, myself, am an immigrant and I have several friends who are also immigrants. I, along with my friends, have come here through legal methods. The ones who continuously cross the borders are not. If they come here through the correct means then I don't have a problem with it. But with what they're doing now, it's a slap in the face to every immigrant who's had to come here lawfully.

Let me say this: Shoeless Joe Jackson was an innocent man. I have read books about him, and he:\n1. Declined the money offered to him by gamblers, and a teammate came in and threw it on his bed.\n2. Told Charles Comisky about it, but he said he didn't care, because Jackson was illiterate.\n3. He asked his manager to bench him for the series when all else failed, he wasn't.\n4. He went on to have one of the best world Series ever, batting .400, making no errors, and hitting the only Home Run in the Series.\n\nSo to answer you question, yes, I do think Joe should be reinstated, because he was one of the best hitters in history. He is the only rookie to hit .400, and he had the 3rd best career average when he was kicked out.
One of the worst things about biting your tongue when eating is it will swell up and cause you to bite it repeatedly - I hate it when that happens!
I doubt strongly that they'll change it anytime soon, however it's an antiquated law. Just like an age requirement. Theres no reason for it, if a person is a citizen they should enjoy equal rights.
It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool. We all do it. You should try sleeping in a different position. It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder. It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist. If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.

As you probably know, it was mainly used only in high level electronics, especially in the aeronautics industry, until the widespread introduction of the catalytic converter where it is used as the catalyst to reduce smog components in automobile exhaust. This gives it quite an edge over other metals, a widespread application which actually uses up the material. However, its price in relation to gold has far outstripped its relative usage, and I think a lot of speculation is involved considering other possible applications such as fuel cells. I would expect increased demand through automotive applications for at least the next twelve years, by which time we may see some shift to new technology, but still at least level demand.

Remember when you FIRST enter the page, there is no such thing about the variable $do since $_POST array does not exist!\n\nI see multiple problems over there.\n- Your form has the method of POST, so why do you use GET ?\n + $do=$_GET['do']; should be $do=$_POST['do'];\n- Now since the variable do does not exist you could do a simple if statement that checks that. The function isset checks if that variable exists.\n + $do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n- But there is another problem, The hidden name for do does not exist.. So lets change it to do\n + <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n\n[now the overall code]\n=============================\n<html>\n<body>\n<?php\n\n// Lets initialize the variable\n$do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n\n// Lets just display the current Action\necho 'ACTION:'.$do;\n\n// Check if the hidden variable was sent\nif ($do == 'send') {\n\n // Lets print out the post array\n var_dump($_POST);\n\n} else { ?>\n <form method="POST" action="">\n <p><input type="submit" value="Submit" name="submit"></p>\n <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n </form>\n<?php } ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n=============================\nI took out the other forms...\n\nThe above should work.. Now.. But why introduce another variable if you already have the submit variable intact? What you could do is say $do = isset($_POST['submit']) ? 'send' : 'Submit'; That will remove that hidden field. Another thing I realize is that your mixing HTML code with PHP code which is BAD PRACTICE. I recommend you to at least separate them, or if you don't want to use a templating engine, I recommend you do at least store the output in one variable like outvar = "". That will take out alot of issues in the future.\n\nAnyways.. Good Luck
"If you build it, they will come" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.\n\nI am not sure where you got the "$22,000" A DAY figure for Google Adwords. I only spend $20 a day on Adwords, and it is just fine with them. I suggest you read the mechanics of Adwords -- or try it out yourself -- so you can see that you can advertise with Adwords even for just $10/day. \n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day." http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\n6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article "10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm for tips on how to improve your conversion rates.\n\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/guide/cases/ii-lexi.htm
yeah, he's not over it either. if you want to get over him, you have to cut off all contact, at least until you feel like you don't want to see him anymore. it's probably going to be longer since he still has feelings for you too. and if you were talking about what to do next but you know its not going to work, i wouldn't even put in the effort. if you think it won't work it won't. i think you're just sad cuz you hurt his feelings, because you know it wouldn't work out anyway. just move on.

You need to be under a doctors care. You need to be keeping a daily log of your blood sugar, so you can take it to your visit. They can advise you on a diet and exercise plan to help you learn to deal with diabetes. They can also determine if you need to be on oral medications, insulin or just a proper diet. Do not ignore this problem, because it can damage all of your vital organs if not controlled.

In Romans 1:20, Paul says "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."\n\nI take this to mean that, if you aren't given the opportunity to learn about Jesus and what God did through him, you can still be saved if you pursue God in the best way you know him. So, the proverbial person in Africa who worships God as he is seen through nature, but never learns about Jesus can still be saved.\n\nBasically, I think God in his infinite wisdom and justice, has a formula that's a bit more complicated than the version explicitly laid out in the Bible (just as I don't believe Hell really is a bit fiery furnace), though I do think those who do learn about Christianity and then still scorn God's offer are setting themselves up for a fall.
Same reason that battle fatigues are in a variety of colors including browns - the striping is there to break up an outline, which it does admirably. Also, pattern recognition in many animals is for a specific form of predator/prey which gets obscured by the stripe pattern against a background. Color is actually of little interests since many animals don't see color.

Like Yale, Harvard is a Corporation.\n\nFrom the WIKI article below:\n\n"The President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation) is the more fundamental of Harvard University's two governing boards. (The other is the Harvard Board of Overseers.) On 9 June 1650, at the request of President Henry Dunster, the Great and General Court of Massachusetts (i.e., the colonial legislature) issued the body's charter, making it the oldest corporation in the western hemisphere. In fact, due to the history of the Haravrd Corporation, its set of laws is written into the laws of the Commonwealth of Masechussets. (Note that although Harvard is today generally referred to as a "University" the corporation's legal title still formally refers to "Harvard College.")\n\nWhen it was originally founded, the corporation was probably intended to be a body of the college's resident instructors, like the fellows of an Oxbridge college. However, from an early date it instead fell into what has become the familiar American model of a governing board -- an outside body, made up mostly of people not involved in Harvard's daily life, which meets regularly to consult with the day-to-day head, the president (whom it appoints). It is self-perpetuating, selecting new members for itself whenever a vacancy opens; in recent years it has always comprised six fellows in addition to the president."

I mean if I'm not invisible. Maybe i can get somethings either from their daily life or activities.

After a loss, it sure doesn't seem like it. Nonetheless, love is one of the best parts of the human experience. You must also remember that having lost what might have seemed your true love doesn't mean that you will never love again. Those with such a capacity for love do find love again, and love with the one who really is your one true love.

diet pills are not the answer. eliminate soda first of all. my mom lost 10 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Just eat healthy food. Dancing is a good exercise, so maybe find some dance exercise videos or put on some good music and go nuts. Don't be depressed, it will make it worse. Just be happy that you are alive and it will be a beautiful day.
good communication is what does it. Can you move beyond small talk and say what's really on your mind. If you start doing this, my expereince is that potentially good friends will respond or shun you. Then you know who the really good friends are.
I happen to know the Director at Bright Horizons, she makes $67,000/yr.
For you, it'll be like trying to ice skate uphill. You are at a severe disadvantage. First, you are nowhere near a good facility to practice. I guess you could beat a ball against a wall (that's what I did for my first 2 years), but without someone to play against, you won't improve much. Second, you don't have access to a good coach. Without a coach, progress will be very slow. If you're serious about going pro, find a coach - now. If you can't afford a private coach, find some videos or DVDs that will show you drills that you can do on your own. And never underestimate the importance of good footware. I've gone through cheap shoes (US$20) in a single day of practice.\n\nGood Luck
The answer to this question is YES.\n\nFirst, all the growth hormones we're pumping into food combined with the multiple generations of (fairly) good prenatal and childhood nutrition, children are physically maturing faster than ever.\n\nSimultaneously, as our life expectancy gets longer and longer, those children have longer to BE children before their brains point out that time is running out and they should be adults. It's widely accepted that Juliet in Romeo and Juliet would have been around 13 years old. But in a world where the average life expectancy was 30, she was already approaching middle age. Since middle age, now, is 40-50 years of age (if you assume that middle age is the part where you're about halfway through your years), then people don't feel the pressures of impending death until their 30s or 40s. Even if they think of death, they can just deny deny deny... And many of us also have parents who helicopter and don't expect us to BE grown-up.\n\nBecause of this, children stay immature mentally and emotionally longer than ever before.\n\nThe part-timers who move in with their parents? They're slackers. And their parents are enabling that behavior. The ones who jump right in already understand that real life is NOW, it's not later, and they're doing what they have to do. Think of it this way: you're going to work your butt off, retire, and die. The only way to avoid this trap is to work hard enough when you're young to retire early enough to enjoy some of life. So the ones who jump right in have the right idea.

They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race. However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights. That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s. She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes. She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement. Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear. Today, we know this woman as Madonna.

God says that man shall not be judged by what he puts in his mouth, but what comes out of his mouth because that is what comes from the heart. It is not good to over eat, and we should treat these bodies as vessels for the Holy Sprit, but we have no "nos" or "yes" on what to eat or drink.

Most of the world's rainforest has already been destroyed. After it is destroyed, it can never be re-created. Therefore, any damage to the rainforest should be prohibited and punished most severely. The eco-systems and the species of the rainforest generally cannot survive elsewhere. It is the responsibility of humans to protect the forms of life which have been so egregiously damaged by human action. Not one centimeter of rainforest should be subject to harm.

I work at a mortgage bank and yes, Credit score is a large factor when lenders determine if they will approve a loan. You can also find a good mortgage brokers near you. They act as agents and work with a variety of lenders to help you find the best program that works for you. there are mortgage programs designed for self employed people or commission based people. Its not that uncommon and the whole experience should not be scary for you. No one will laugh in your face, but they will be honest with you and let you know if they can help or not.

If he does not have the courtesy, decency, and maturity to speak with you about whatever may be troubling him about the current relationship situation, then honestly, you are better off without him. I know that sounds cold, but I feel that you will find it to be quite accurate later on.\n\nBest of luck. If he wants you, he'll call you. If not - brush yourself off, and find a guy who has good sense and enough maturity to talk to you about such matters.
I'm not a teenager anymore (darn it!), but...\n\nHow about "Ask Tina Anything" -- this would give them the idea that you are open to answer any question without emphasising the idea that you are "Mom." \n\nIf they wanted to ask a Mom, they would ask their own. It may be comforting for them to know that you have kids, and ARE a mom, but teens won't want you to be "Mom" first when they ask a question.\n\nGreat idea, and I wish you well!

She had Alzheimer's, although in 1975 they did not use that term - it was just 'senile' then, and had to live the last four years of her life with constant care in a nursing home. I visited her three times a week and even though she didn't have her mind I think she always knew who I was because even though she didn't verbalize at that point she always got upset when my father (her son) visited without me (he stopped every day on his way into work).\n\nWhen I visited my grandmother I noticed the many other men and women in the home who did not have anyone visiting them. Being the young child I was I started visiting them too so that when I went I had my 'rounds' to make.\n\nIt caused a lot of happiness in these people to be remembered even if it was only by a small child who was not biologically connected to them in any way. It taught me a lesson in love that to this day I will never forget. It also taught me that every human life has value and should never be forgotten.\n\nI am thankful for the lesson that that experience has taught me.
Cloture is a parliamentary procedure by which debate is ended and an immediate vote is taken on the matter under discussion.\n\nIf HIMMA is enacted, it would allow insurers to offer health plans that are exempt from state consumer protection laws, including mental health parity, psychology “freedom of choice,” mental health benefit mandates and mandated offering laws. \n\nWithout these state requirements insurers would be able to offer “barebones plans.” The only condition is that they also offer employers an alternative plan based on the state employee benefits in one of the five most populous states, which could also be “barebones.” As a result, the benefits in the alternative plan may still be inadequate.

Not very many people know this, but Neil Diamond is not his real name:\n\n...His real name was Genuflect Zirconium...\n\nBut his manager felt it didn't have the right "RING" to it, so he 'PROPOSED' that he change it to something a bit more 'ENGAGING". The overall 'RECEPTION' to the change was astoundingly favorable, and allowed him to "CROSS THE THRESHOLD" into pop stardom. He has signed record deals with a number of record labels ("VIRGIN" records, however, is not one of them)...\n\n...;)

I think a lot of teens feel pain due to lack of a father. I think a lot of them don't even know what is missing. But a father is very important. \nI know one boy who had a lot of trouble and was in Juvenal Hall and drug rehab. He was telling me one time about the "weird" thing the therapists were saying in group therapy. They were saying that a lot of the boys' problems were related to their fathers. He said to me, "How can my father have anything to do with my problems, when I hardly ever see him?" His mother also thought this was a "weird" idea. I said that it was the fact that his father wasn't involved in his life, but spent most of his time drunk instead, that the therapists thought was harming the son. Not to mention the abusive stepfather. The boy and his mom just couldn't see that this was a problem.\nI agree that some kids handle the situation better than others, and so do some mothers.\nMy own daughter was raised without a father, and I think this had a negative effect on her despite the best I could do for her. I think she was always looking for male affection, and would do anything for a guy. Anything. I feel so sad that she feels there is only one way to get a man's love. By the way, she did pretty well until she was fifteen also. \nBut like you said, everybody's different. \nThe sister of the boy I mentioned, same mother and father, had her problems but determined to have a better life. She's in the Navy now and has a nice boyfriend. She's a very responsible person.
The formula for finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nYou need the spacing, d:\n\n113 = 2 + (38 - 1)d\n111 = 37d\nd = 3\n\nThe formula for finding the sum of the sequence is\n\nS = n[2a1 + (n - 1)d] / 2\n= 38[2(2) + (38 - 1)3] /2\n= 38(4 + 111)/2\n= 38(115)/2\n= 2185

58 poems between now and 19th May... that's a lot for teachers to expect!!! \n\nDo the best you can. \n\nWrite as many as you can each day, and make each one totally different. Some which rhyme, some which are just one word per line. \n\nGo on you can do it! It will be worth it once you've got it done. It's just that you're looking at the "big picture" right now. \n\nTake one step at a time!\nGet inspiration from your life, what has happened to you this year? How did it feel to be little in a world of grownups? Have you ever had a pet?\n\nWrite about feelings. What are you feeling right now? What was the best feeling you've ever felt? What was the worst? Emotions are good inspiration, whether it's happy emotions or crappy ones. \nGo for a walk outside and write down the first five things you see.\n\nGood Luck

I guess the one thing that comes to mind is when I was doing some work for an elderly lady (no kin to me). I was repairing her bathroom and to do the job properly, I had to buy materials that were not in my budget. I had to sacrifice my time and materials that I would have spent on my house (it needs repairs too) so that the little lady could have a nice bathroom without worrying about it leaking, etc.. Of course, the hug that I got for doing the work and the God given heartwarming that I experienced made it feel like there was really no sacrifice at all. I try to help others all of the time, but I get as much blessing out of it as compared to the relative sacrifice. The little lady never knew that I had to purchase additional materials because she had given me the money (collected at her church) to do the work. Anyway, I guess I'll keep on doing what I need to do as God directs me.
She married in 1991 and has two daughters.

Typically they are gas pockets that form around those areas, and get stuck. However though, if the pain does not go away after just a few minutes...and it lingers, or becomes worse...I encourage you to see a physician immediately; especially if it is near the heart area. Also, if you begin to feel like your left arm is numb, tingling or any other pain...also see the doctor.
Oh, I sent lots of packages. I can't remember them all, but here are a few.\n\nOne was to "keep it cool" (since it gets hot there)- pitcher, kohl-aid packets, ice tea packets, small battery operated fan, ice cream flavored Baskin Robins candy, deodorant \n\nChristmas package (it is that time if you celebrate)-small tree already decorated. You can wire the ornaments on so they will stay through the mail, a stocking stuffed with goodies.\n\nDid you send him a pillow yet? My husband always wanted a nice pillow, so of course, I sprayed it with my perfume.\n\nPicture frames with pictures of you!!! Lots of love letters!\n\nI sent some cheap $1 DVDs from Wal-Mart for him to play on his laptop. Comedies. And popcorn (already popped unless he has a microwave.)\n\nAt Wal-greens you can make all kinds of fun stuff with\npictures.

I read the following from hoopsworld.com:\n\n"Ernie Johnson is one of my heroes and is simply in my mind one of the best of the television commentators in his role with TNT. The recent disclosure that he suffers and has been treated for a fairly common but somewhat mysterious form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma commonly known as a follicular type is surely a sad thing, but this is a type of cancer that people often live many years with and treatments continue to evolve. \n\nThis point was stressed in a statement released by the Atlanta Sports Network and also found on USA Today on the 22nd:\n\n"Two and a half years ago, in August of 2003, I was diagnosed with 'follicular' Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This is a low-grade and treatable cancer -- not as aggressive as some other forms...The only reason I'm bringing my condition to your attention now is because the swelling of a lymph node near my left ear has become noticeable to viewers of TNT and there have been questions asked." \n\nIn the same statement it was also mentioned that he plans to seek some additional treatment after the end of the year."
Yes, it was enlisted personnel who did it. Not necessarily "lower echelon" enlisted (a Staff Sergeant is already serving time), but enlisted.\n\nI do not believe ANY commander would ORDER his people to do that. I have spent far too long in the military than to know better than that. But I certainly do believe their command knew about it and condoned it.

50% of the Aries - Aquarius relationship ends in divorce.\n50% of the Aries - Aquarius relationship ends up marriage.\n\nWrong? Then, prove it!\n\nYou see, astrology are for READERS. Life is for DOERS. As you said you are in love and wants to marry her. Its serious man! cum on!!!\n\nI would suggest one thing: take good things from astrology - good advice, good prediction, good match and reject bad things like bad prediction, bad advice.\n\nIts upon you.\n\nI am Aries n by gf is Aquarius. We are fine. Both of us doesnt like quarrel or argument, so stays out of it. We give each other the freedom and space. She is cute and I am hard, tough and aggressive. I love her and I will protect her always. She will love me as long as I will.\n\nLOVE IS GIVING. It like a saving account. The more money you save in your account the more you get when you need.\n\nLOVE is in the pleasure of Giving. Dont think about what you are getting. Just give her love, love and love.\n\nIf you find comfort in giving her unconditional love then you are done buddy. Life is a one shot game. There is no trial for anything. You do it or you dont.\n\nThe only thing will which make you happy (with or without her) is how much LOVE you can GIVE.\n\nGoodLuck!

The paper is called "papyrus". The ancient Egyptian capital was Amarna. Jars that held embalmed organs were called "canopic jars". Osiris was the god of the dead and lord of the underworld. The chemical used to preserve the bodies was called "natron". The closest word to the meaning of "mummify" is "enbalm". The Egyptian sign of life was the "ankh", a symbol worn by gods and goddesses to show immortality.
Paris Reidhead\n1919-1992\n\n Paris Reidhead devoted his life to communicating the message of the Gospel in America and throughout the world. A student pastor in the rural Minnesota at age eighteen, Mr. Reidhead felt led of the Lord to overseas mission work. In 1945, Paris Reidhead and Marjorie, his wife of two years, traveled under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission to the Sudan-Ethiopia Border where they surveyed and analyzed tribal languages in preparation for evangelism and education in this area.\n\n Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Reidhead was appointed Deputation Secretary of the Sudan Interior Mission in the Southeastern United States. He was soon a nationally recognized spokesman for missions.\n\n In 1953 Mr. Reidhead began his national Bible Conference ministry for the Christian and Missionary Alliance which brought him, in 1956, to pastorate of the Gospel Tabernacle, the New York City church where the C & M A was first established by Dr. A. B. Simpson in 1887. While in New York, Mr. Reidhead drew on informational resources at the United Nations to pioneer a program through which government and private funds were used for economic development in the Third World; his efforts to implement local programs on this model took him to mission fields in Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\n Third World development became his full-time commitment in 1966. Mr. Reidhead's vision of public-private funding for economic development led, in 1971, to the formation of the Institute for International Development, Inc. which has served as the model for about ninety evangelical organizations which have, in turn, channeled more than 100 million dollars into Third World development. In 1984, Mr. Reidhead founded Enterprise Development International, a service agency devoted to aiding Third World church and evangelical agencies in creating job opportunities for destitute families.\n\n Since Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, and a dedicated Board. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world
Forget the books, you need to get rid of this guy. I don't neccessarily perscribe to the idea of "once a cheater always a cheater," but in this case your husband is still talking to this other woman. It really doesn't matter if they're arguing when they talk..point is..he's not respecting you and your relationship enough to let this other woman go. Instead of reading books on how to make him stop cheating, start reading books on how to love and respect yourself. You may find your eyes open quite a bit when you realize how much you're worth!
How long a drug stays in you system is beside the point. What matter most is what kind of lab test will be performed to determine.\n\nTHE DRUG ITSELF can stay in your bloodstream up to 72 hours. However, most labs look for the metabolite, which is something that the body produces when it ingests something, in the case of cocaine it is "benzoylecgonine" that will stay around long after the drug is gone, up to 30 days for a frequent user.\n\nIf the lab prefer to take hair as a sample, cocaine can stay in your hair up to about 90 days. Nevertheless, new information is becomming apparent suggesting cocaine stay's in your hair about 25 years - even after you have only taken it once.\n\nAnd if you boyfriend has smoked weed, he definately don't have a chance. A minimum of thirty (30) days, minimum!\n\nAs medical science and employers become more and more aware of the problem exsisting in drug testing, they are choosing more complex, sophisicated testing methods. With these techniques and equipment, the only sure way to pass a test is to not do drugs and stay clear away from them.\n\nHope this answers your question!

Consider this, everyone thinks they are right. That's why people argue. Some folks not only think they are right but won't even consider the idea that they could be wrong. Now add to that the idea that God is always right and they feel that God is on their side. Well that makes them not only "always right" but better than you (in their eyes). Even though they will say they are not better than you, they have the "I'm a winner" attitude cause the bible told them so. And we all know that the winner is the better player. So they have won before the game has ended. Or so they believe.

That depends on the personalities of the people in your family. Age is a key factor. Teens never want to do anything as a family, remember when you were a kid.\n\nTo answer the question without more information......\n\nFrisbee in the park.\nAmusement parks\nGoing to the beach\nGoing to the mountains\nGoing to an arcade with games for everyone\nRiding bikes on a bike trail\nGoing for a walk or hike\n\nTalk to your family and see what they want to do.

Planck was one of the people who was thinking of energy as being delivered in discrete amounts or bundles. This was one of the clues that lead Einstein to conclude in his 'Photo-electric Effect' experiments that, again, energy was being absorbed at only very specific frequencies and possibly in specific bundles of energy.\n\nThen you get to thinking of light as photons to carry the energy and materials seem to only absorb special kinds of bundles of energy and some guys in Stockholm start thinking that energy changes in atoms occur in discrete quanta. Neils Bohr and friends were trying to come up with equations to describe the orbit of the electron around the nucleus and put some of the Planck stuff together with the Einstein stuff and came up with the idea that electrons could only change orbits according to the energy quanta that they absorbed and emitted.\n\nFrom all this we get the basics of quantum mechanics, sub-atomic orbital mechanics, lasers, fluorescent lights, bunches of stuff :).
easiest way may be to (very carefully!) melt the aluminum off with a torch.\n\nI think cast iron has a melting point of about 900C, and aluminum has a lower melting point of around 700C, so maybe you can melt the aluminum and let gravity remove it for you. the only problem might be iron tends to retain heat rather better than aluminum so it would be a slow process...\n\ngood luck!
This is tough, but you are obviously dealing with an HR staff that doesn't have enough faith in their company.\n\nSalary ranges are one of those areas where you only see what YOU want. For example. If HR says the job pays from $35-$40k a year. They want to hire you at $35k. But if you say, my range is $35-$40k, you really want $40k. It is just natural human perception.\n\nEven though your attitude is correct, salary negotiations should not be discussed until the point the company wants to hire you, you are stuck in this one. If you don't put the range on, HR will can your resume because you didn't follow a simple direction. They have asked for this because they have found that what the company thinks the skills are worth, and what people that hold the skills think their worth, are two very different things.\n\nYou have no choice, but you can beat them at their own game. Just keep it very vague, something like:\n\nRequested Salary Range: Mid $40's \n\nJust don't be tempted to lowball your requirements to get the interview. If you do, your offer will never be what you want, it will be what you stated.\n\nGood luck

Occasionally, a second, dimmer secondary rainbow is seen outside the primary bow. Secondary rainbows are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the raindrops, and appear at an angle of 50°–53°. As a result of the second reflection, the colours of a secondary rainbow are inverted compared to the primary bow, with blue on the outside and red on the inside. The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.\n\nHope this helps!
I can take a reasonable guess not having looked at how it's implemented...\n\nOnce the object exists there will be almost no difference. Remember, a class is simply a collection of functions that have protected access to a group of variables. The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store. Putting them in objects is simply more convenient in so many ways. You pay a tiny bit in performance for that, but you probably use less developer resources (if they count here).

Just over the horizon there’s a raging storm.\nRacism disguised as “immigration reform”.\nMen, women and children risk their lives every day,\nTo come to America for the American way.\nSome racists want to say these people don’t belong,\nBut bigots are too ignorant to see they are wrong.\nHard working, honest and more religious than most,\nImmigrants fill undesirable jobs from coast to coast.\nUs Americans waste life on what we don’t need,\nWhile immigrants work hard for the families they feed.\nOften performing foul jobs for far less than they deserve,\nTo say immigrants don’t belong here takes a lot of nerve.\nThese people are my sisters and my brothers,\nAnd they have rights just like any others.\nI understand with terrorists and war,\nWe have to be more careful than ever before,\nBut no matter what the Republicans say\nBreeding hate is not the way!\nAmerica was once the “melting pot” of the world,\nNow our reputation has been forever soiled.\nIf this is the way Americans want America to be,\nThen we should dismantle the Statue of Liberty.\nI hope these racists will always keep in mind,\nIf they look at their history what they will find.\nMost of their descendants except for a few,\nWere at one time immigrants too.\n\nWayne

Try Ebay or even Google the specific player you're looking for.\n\nOr here's a couple of websites that may have what you're looking for:\nhttp://www.prosportsmemorabilia.com/home.aspx?google=9900910&engine=adwords!6526&keyword=%2Asports+autograph%2A&match_type=&gclid=CNG94cHJq4gCFRZrNAodMz1TkA\n\nhttp://www.authenticsportscollectibles.com/\n\nI don't know where you live, but I've gotten autographs from players by going to an open practice. I'm a Stars fan, so my boyfriend bought a picture of Eric Lindros (he's actually in Toronto uniform) online (he got that for $5), and had Lindros personalize it for me. It's my favorite autograph so far! Anyway if you find a schedule of their open practices, just go down to the arena, and wait for them to come out of the locker room. Good luck!
only have one word to answer that......\n\nPELE!!!\n\nNo question about this. For almost 50 years now, he has been the most recognized player in the world. In fact, in survey conducted a few years back, he actually was recognized worldwide as #1 athlete in the world. He was ranked higher than Muhammad Ali and Micheal Jordan. Enough said.

I think to incorporate an "in memory" favor would be in poor taste. I think the idea is very heartfelt and sincere, but not appropriate for a wedding favor. The idea of a favor is to provide you guest with a memento from YOUR special day. I can understand why it is important to include her in some way, and I think it's important that you do. Have you considered acknowledging her in another way?? Maybe a toast, special dance, or something like that? Good luck.

http://remove.getmirar.com/uninstall.html\nor\nUNINSTALL MIRAR !!!!!\n\nThis solution works brilliantly for WIndows Xp (if you are administrator/you installed mirar by your user)\n\nI had mirar installed on my laptop through some rogue site. I found many ways to "apparentlly" uninstall mirar ( like the one in http://www.spyany.com/program/article_spw_rm_Mirar.html) but I could not do it.\n\nThe entries in the registry are arbitary and not as given in various sites. Also I could not delete the file saying the file was in use . ( I did not have any IE open ).\n\nSo this is what I did :--\n1. Search for all *.dll in the modified range of 1 day ( I knew when it had got installed ).\n2. Deleted the files from &#92;windows&#92;winnb*.dll. But one file could not be deleted\n3. Removed all permissions on the dll file for all users using security tab on properties.\nMirar has vanished.\n\nor\n\nFirst I followed the steps on the following pages: http://www.adoko.com/resource/mirar-toolbar.asp\n\nhttp://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/adware.mirar.html\n\nThe bar was gone but still I had a pop-up when opening the internet explorer. Then I ran adware. It showed me all relevant files. But, I didn't want to purchase it, so I uninstalled manually. Just follow the path displayed.\n\nThe registry you can enter clicking start and then the button under "search". I am German, so it says "Ausführen". There you enter "regedit" and you are in and can search for the registry files and delete them.\n\nThe only thing I can not delete is also mirar related. In the software install/uninstall menu I found something called "related page". The computer is not able to delete it. Clicking on it shows an empty window with "uninstall mirar" in the frame. Can anyone help me with that one???\nThanks a million Sujoy! By the way, the filenames are:\nMediaPassC.dll\nWinDmy.dll\nWinNB57.dll\n\nBy starting windows in Safe Mode (press F8), you can actually delete all of the above files... Also, you can delete the directory:\n\nc:&#92;Program Files&#92;Media Center (or something like that... one of the above files is located in this folder)
I searched, but couldn't find anything on that show :(

First of all, you have to make the mess THEIR problem or their habits won't change. Because they live there, too, you'll want to be diplomatic about it, or an ongoing fight will ensue and they'll probably make a bigger mess.

good communication is what does it. Can you move beyond small talk and say what's really on your mind. If you start doing this, my expereince is that potentially good friends will respond or shun you. Then you know who the really good friends are.

As a paramedic, that looks good to me. You didn't mention your age or any health problems. If I were to see you in my ambulance, providing you didn't have any trauma, that is not a treatable blood pressure. Go to the American Heart Association web site. There is good info on blood pressure education. Also, don't hesitate to sit at one of those automated blood pressure machines at the pharmacy (Target, Walmart) and just get it checked. Most fire departmants welcome people to get their pressure checked for free. I took several people right to the hospital because I felt like they could stroke out any minute. Saved a life or two I'm sure.
I don't think gender matters as much as knowledge and bedside manner. I have seen great male and female doctors. I have also seen and will never see again some male and female doctors. My primary care doctor is great and is female. My ENT is great and a male.
For you, it'll be like trying to ice skate uphill. You are at a severe disadvantage. First, you are nowhere near a good facility to practice. I guess you could beat a ball against a wall (that's what I did for my first 2 years), but without someone to play against, you won't improve much. Second, you don't have access to a good coach. Without a coach, progress will be very slow. If you're serious about going pro, find a coach - now. If you can't afford a private coach, find some videos or DVDs that will show you drills that you can do on your own. And never underestimate the importance of good footware. I've gone through cheap shoes (US$20) in a single day of practice.\n\nGood Luck

It's good to floss but not too much. If you floss until you see pink then you have cut your gums and bacteria could get into them and get infected. Floss gently and you should be okay.

Senior BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, who underwent a second surgery last night after he developed complications in the kidneys, has been put on dialysis and his condition continues to be critical.\n\nHinduja hospital Director (administration) Anupam Verma told reporters today that Mr Mahajan is still on the ventilator. \n\nHe is under medication for his blood pressure.\n\nHe said the BJP leader's kidney functions are poor and, therefore, he has been put on dialysis. Mr Mahajan is being monitored closely for his pancreatic and liver injuries even though his liver bleeding has stopped. \n\nMr Verma said efforts are on by Dr G B Davar and his team to stabilise him before contemplating any further intervention.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Stefen Dave, vice president of the Australian College of Surgeons, has arrived here to to see Mr Mahajan, on the request of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Dr Dave, a trauma specialist, has been conducting training for doctors across India for the last six years. \n\nDr Dave said he was in Ahmedabad as a part of a training programme and was asked by Mr Modi to visit Mr Mahajan in Mumbai. \n\nHe said he was impressed by the treatment given to Mr Mahajan and added that a high-level British team of doctors is already present and appropriate medication and decisions are in place.\n\nMr Mahajan has sustained three bullet wounds when his brother Pravin allegedly shot him at his Worli residence here on Saturday morning

Cloture is a parliamentary procedure by which debate is ended and an immediate vote is taken on the matter under discussion.\n\nIf HIMMA is enacted, it would allow insurers to offer health plans that are exempt from state consumer protection laws, including mental health parity, psychology “freedom of choice,” mental health benefit mandates and mandated offering laws. \n\nWithout these state requirements insurers would be able to offer “barebones plans.” The only condition is that they also offer employers an alternative plan based on the state employee benefits in one of the five most populous states, which could also be “barebones.” As a result, the benefits in the alternative plan may still be inadequate.

In general, no, you don't need to pay off your old loans before you can borrow new ones. In certain cases, your repayment status can affect whether you will be allowed to borrow new loans at your new school. If you are in default on any federal loans, you need to resolve the default before you can get any new federal loans. However, resolving your default typically entails making 6 months of on-time payments -- but not paying the loan off completely.\n\nIf you didn't default on the old loans -- if you're making payments when required, etc. -- you should be fine to borrow new ones. The only exception to this would be if, somehow, you have exceeded the aggregate debt limit for that loan type. The undergraduate *Stafford* loan limit for dependent students is $23,000 (the limit for independent students is $46,000). Do you currently owe that much? If not, you'll be fine.\n\nJust file the FAFSA online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov. When it is processed, you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) with the results -- the Comments section will let you know if there are eligibility issues that you need to tend to.

Traveling at 31.25 m/s, the ball would reach 20 m in .64 seconds.\n\nAccording to Galileo's free-fall, objects have a 9.81 acceleration.\n\nSo, in .64 seconds, the ball would have fallen 2.00704 m.\n\nSubtract that from 5 m, you would get a number greater than 2 m, so I assume that if would clear the wall. I think.\n\n(To Above) Isn't time equal to distance divided by velocity? For example, it travels at 31.25 m/s, so it would travel 31.25 meter in one second. Doesn't that go to say that 20 meter would take less than a second?
Without a doubt, my freshman year History teacher. To start, he had more DUI's than anyone I know. He was/is an alcoholic who took out his anger on the girls in the class - and it was always the girls.\n\nWe did a unit on slavery and for a full two weeks he informed the class that all the girls were slaves and that the boys could treat the girls horribly during class for that entire two week period. Back then, we had to put up with it. Nowadays, he wouldn't have a job. The sad thing is he still does teach...

Yes i do believe in dragons.\n\nDragons probably originated as one of many branches of the reptiles, no later than 200,000,000 years ago in the late Triassic. This was a period of great reptile diversification, during which emerged some of the most successful reptile groups, in terms of both abundance and diversification. Dragon evolution echoes the evolution of the archosaurs of the time. Dragons took to the air, as did the pterosaurs, and became aquatic, like the plesiosaurs.\n\nPlease check the site it may be of help to you.

For me it was my grandmother. She was 76 when I was born and almost 87 when she died. She had Alzheimer's, although in 1975 they did not use that term - it was just 'senile' then, and had to live the last four years of her life with constant care in a nursing home. I visited her three times a week and even though she didn't have her mind I think she always knew who I was because even though she didn't verbalize at that point she always got upset when my father (her son) visited without me (he stopped every day on his way into work).\n\nWhen I visited my grandmother I noticed the many other men and women in the home who did not have anyone visiting them. Being the young child I was I started visiting them too so that when I went I had my 'rounds' to make.\n\nIt caused a lot of happiness in these people to be remembered even if it was only by a small child who was not biologically connected to them in any way. It taught me a lesson in love that to this day I will never forget. It also taught me that every human life has value and should never be forgotten.\n\nI am thankful for the lesson that that experience has taught me.

DUI is not a national law, each state has their own statute(s) dealing with it.\n\nYour question isn't especially clear, I'm afraid. You got a DUI in California, and without knowing when you're going to move to New York, you want us to tell you if your record will be cleaned up?\n\nA DUI conviction will ordinarily stay on your California driving record for ten years. I don't know if that's the answer you were looking for, but it's the only one I can come up with based on your question.
Contrary to what you may think, the term has nothing to do with the stereotypical frugal Scotsman. Actually, a "scot" or "sceot" was a municipal tax in 12th century England, and someone who went "scot-free" was one who succeeded in dodging that tax. Scot also came to mean the amount owed for entertainment in a tavern, including drinks. If you got a free drink, you drank "scot-free".

Build the facility in a way that you'd want it to be built if you were the one who was going to have to work or live there. Don't skimp or do shoddy work, serve the clients with a smile. . . that sort of thing. Manage it in the same way. Jesus said to love God with all your heart, and your neighbors just like yourself. Apply that simple rule to any choice you need to make when building or managing the facility, and you'll make the right choice. God never makes it difficult to know how to serve Him.

On the left side, the last note (lowest) is a A on the right side (highest), it is a C.\n\nIf you are asking how many pitches in the C major scale, the pitches are: C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C (octave above). On the entire piano, all the white keys are in C major.

Not very many people know this, but Neil Diamond is not his real name:\n\n...His real name was Genuflect Zirconium...\n\nBut his manager felt it didn't have the right "RING" to it, so he 'PROPOSED' that he change it to something a bit more 'ENGAGING". The overall 'RECEPTION' to the change was astoundingly favorable, and allowed him to "CROSS THE THRESHOLD" into pop stardom. He has signed record deals with a number of record labels ("VIRGIN" records, however, is not one of them)...\n\n...;)
I recently spoke to someone locally who gave me some information regarding this, and I believe that he said that everything was going through the VA. At the very least, they should be able to point you in the right direction.

Involuntary muscles are smooth, uninucleated, non-branching muscles that are not directly controllable at will. These include the radially arranged iris muscles, the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and are all controlled by the autonomic nervous systemThese muscles are not as free as the voluntary muscles such as your arms legs, fingers, etc..\n\nThe cardiac muscle in heart can be called an involuntary muscle, although it may be classified separately due to its structural differences. it is controlled by nerve impulses produced by a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, the rate of which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. smooth muscles are found in the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\n\nSkeletal muscle is under conscious control and is, therefore, voluntary muscle.\n\n voluntary muscles =Somatic nervous system=The somatic nervous system is that part of the peripheral nervous system associated with the voluntary control of body movements through the action of skeletal muscles, and also reception of external stimuli. The somatic nervous system consists of afferent fibers that receive information from external sources, and efferent fibers that are responsible for muscle contraction.\n\nThe somatic system includes all the neurons connected with the muscles, sense organs and skin. It deals with sensory information and controls the movement of the body.\n\nThe basic route of the efferent somatic nervous system includes a two neuron sequence. The first is the upper motor neuron, whose cell body is located in the precentral gyrus (Brodman Area 4) of the brain. It receives stimuli from this area to control skeletal (voluntary) muscle. The upper motor neuron carries this stimulus down the corticospinal tract and synapses in the ventral horn of the spinal cord with the alpha motor neuron, a lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs and these are received by nicotinic receptors on the alpha motor neuron. The alpha motor neurons cell body sends the stimulus down its axon via the ventral root of the spinal cord and proceeds to its neuromuscular junction of its skeletal muscle. There, it releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs to the muscles nicotinic receptors, resulting in stimulus to contract the muscle.

The school i go to is so unorganized, so that means the students would be the same way with their schedules. What stressed me out was that I started a class, and the teacher knew some of the students couldn't be in the class because we didn't have a prerequsite, so the semester was almost finished, and the President of the school decided to let us drop the class. So that made me had to stay back another semester.

wen excercising there is a larger concentration of carbon dioxide in ur blood ...this increased concentration will increase the concentration gradient between blood stream and air in alveoli...increase in concentration gradient will increase the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen...the function of breathing is exchanging the air which are <used up>.{which means that the air has a very low concentration gradient with blood}exchanging the used up gas with new air to keep the steep concentration gradient between air in lungs and blood stream...as the air is being <used up> faster so it must be exchanged faster to keep oxygen supplied at a steady rate....this is the reason but how this process is induced is not fully understood..(biology is very strange most of its branches are not fully understood)

Consider this, everyone thinks they are right. That's why people argue. Some folks not only think they are right but won't even consider the idea that they could be wrong. Now add to that the idea that God is always right and they feel that God is on their side. Well that makes them not only "always right" but better than you (in their eyes). Even though they will say they are not better than you, they have the "I'm a winner" attitude cause the bible told them so. And we all know that the winner is the better player. So they have won before the game has ended. Or so they believe.

No, not all religions believe that killing yourself or another being is a sin. \n"ROLLIN: Historically, in most religious traditions, suicide has been considered a sin. In light of this, many survivors have felt religiously stranded. How can their faith help them heal when that same faith may fault their loved one for the act of suicide?"(pbs.org)\n\nBuddhism- Under conditions of illnesses will accept suicide and dismiss it as a sin.\n\nChristianity- It is a sin under Christianity, the bible says "thou shalt not kill" so take it as it's said. Cain killed Abel and God according to the bible said the following: "What have you done? I hear the voice of your brother's blood crying to me from the ground. Now you will be cursed on the earth soaked with your brother's blood which was drawn by your own hand." And therefore, that instance became known as the first murder in the bible and the first broken family.\n\nConfusianism- also allows suicide under certain circumstances...such as illness\n\nHinduism- hardly and RARELY allows cases of suicide\n\nIslam- Condems the idea and the action of suicide

Perhaps there are other dynamics at play among the users of this category. Your question and your responses have more of a moral approach, ie. you look for the positive; you wish to reason and extract some compassion because, after all, they (Mexicans) are from Planet Earth (humans). \n\nUnfortunately, the responses from the general users of this forum resort to a stereotype of the Mexican population. We say Mexican, because we don't hear any other race being discussed here. Do you honestly think they would stop labeling the Mexicans if their status is LEGAL? We think it's a great excuse to hide behind the "we are not against Mexicans, we are against Illegal Mexicans." The focus is race, on prejudice, and aimed at how every American's tax dollars go to subsidize the illegals. The truth is most of the kiddie generations on this post don't have a job; the truth is their IQ level is not emtionally suited to deal with the differences that makes the world go round. What's more, the working population of America will pay their accountants to pay as little tax as possible. Most of it is parroting what is in the news or what the kiddies hear at home. If the likes of the hadenoughs and sugarpies ran the world of International affairs, God help us all. \n\n\nSo to answer your basic question, is there more to this? Of course, it is bigotry in denial! And we will call them out when we see it, because some one has to remind the sugars of the vinegar they spew in the name of opinion, free speech and being so very American!-- all the while creating a problem when one does not exist and then ask "Who, me?" (hadenough). \n\nApproaching anything "emotionally correct" is the ticket to avoiding conflict.\n\nSome things never change and there will always be people justifying their behavior. It takes courage for people to tell themselves the truth, and insecurity prevails in the category of IMMIGRATION posts. Stay positive in your EMPATHETIC approach and keep provoking the cerebral processes!\n\nAdditional comment: \n\nWell, well, we told you they would bite; and the focus continues to be deep and thought provoking: pants down? pants up? is that like "inhale" -- "exhale"? had enough fruitcake?\n\nLove, Brittany!

first, they are the same\nnext, when it comes to evaluating them, we know that the part in the parenthesis means that tan(theta)=x/2\nsince tan is y/x, then y = x and x = 2\nto find r, use the pythagorean theorem so that x^2 + 2^2 = r^2\nmaking r = the square root of (x^2 + 4)\nso, the cos, being x/r would be 2/square root of(x^2 + 4)\nIf you wanted to remove the radical from the denominator, multiply both sides by the square root of (x^2 + 4) and simplify to get the final answer of (2*the square root of (x^2 + 4))/(x^2 + 4)
You should specify more the programming language context.\n\nIn general, passing by value means the subprogramme that receives the value gets a copy and cannot, thus, modify the original variable used by the caller. It's often said that the function may not produce side-effects.\n\nPassing by reference allows for side effects.\n\nBut many languages make this a little more complicated. You may pass a "reference" or a "pointer" by value, which means that the original pointer will still point to the same object/memory area when the subprogramme returns. But if the pointer is not marked constant, then the contents pointed to may suffer changes.

OUCH!!! I hope this wasn't something you did recently! I've actually been pretty fortunate in that all my injuries have been relatively minor (broken toes and fingers, the occasional broken rib), but I had an interesting experience with electricity that I'd like to share.\n\nI was testing a piece of RADAR equipment on a ship and was following along with the Maintenance Requirements Card. The card said "Turn on the test equipment", which had a metal ON/OFF switch that turned out to be broken, causing 110 volts to shoot through me when I turned it on. I bounced off the wall behind me and, somewhat dazed, looked at the card again to see if that was one of the requirements. It didn't say anything about bouncing off the wall and, in my altered state of consciousness, I decided that the voltage on the switch couldn't be doing the test equipment any good so I reached out and switched it off...sending another jolt through me and bouncing me off the wall again!!!

The sky in latitudes closer to the equator does appear to be a darker shade of blue, and here's why:\n\nThe blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of wavelengths as the light from the sun penetrates the atmosphere. When the sun is overhead, short wavelengths (like blue and violet) get scattered the most, because the light has to penetrate less atmosphere to reach us. When the sun is low in the sky, as in during sunset, the light from the sun has to penetrate much more atmosphere than when it is overhead, because it comes in at an angle. As a result, the longer wavelength light (like red) penetrates more easily than the short-wavelength blue, which got scattered way back when the light first hits the atmosphere. This is why sunsets appear to be red. \n\nWith this in mind, consider that at latitudes near the equator are more likely, on average, to have the sun in a position more directly overhead than say, where I live, at about 45 degrees north latitude. Hence, where I live, the short-wavelength light gets filtered out just a little bit more than where you live, creating a lighter-colored sky. I also live at high altitude (about 6500 ft.), which increases the effect. A little long, but hope this helps.

They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race. However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights. That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s. She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes. She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement. Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear. Today, we know this woman as Madonna.

Epidermolysis bullosa is just one in a group of blistering skin conditions. The skin is so fragile in people with epidermolysis bullosa that even minor rubbing may cause blistering. At times, the person may not be aware of rubbing or injuring the skin even though blisters develop. In severe epidermolysis bullosa, blisters are not confined to the outer skin. They may develop inside the body, in such places as the linings of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, upper airway, bladder, and the genitals. Most forms of epidermolysis bullosa are evident at birth. This disorder can be both disabling and disfiguring, and some forms may lead to early death. The disease results when skin layers separate after minor trauma. Defects of several proteins within the skin are at fault. \n\nTo pick up a baby with severe epidermolysis bullosa, place the child on a soft material and support the under the buttocks (bottom) and behind the neck. A baby with epidermolysis bullosa should never be picked up under the arms. To protect the skin from injury, avoid overheating by keeping rooms at an even temperature, apply lubricants to the skin to reduce friction and keep the skin moist, use simple, soft clothing that requires minimal handling when dressing a child, use sheepskin on car seats and other hard surfaces, and put mittens on at bedtime to help prevent scratching. When blisters appear, the objectives of care are to reduce pain or discomfort, prevent excessive loss of body fluid, promote healing, and prevent infection. If infection appears, it should be promptly treated.

There could be three possible reasons why your sound card no longer works. Assuming you had sound before, it could be the sound card itself, the speakers or the driver that makes the sound card work. \nThe speakers are the easiest to get off the list. Get a pair of headphones and plug them in "input" jack on your sound card. If you hear sound, then it's your speakers, check to insure they are turned on and the wire isn't broken.\nNext is the driver. If you are running Windows XP you can go to the device manager and see if windows thinks the sound card is working, if not use the windows hardware wizard to see if windows can sort things out and that also include the updated driver.\nLast is your sound card might be dead. Well first check to insure it is still seated into the mother board if you have a plug in sound card, but you might have a sound card built into your motherboard and with that, you might need to disable your built in card and get a replacement plug in card.

Its not true. India, to be frank, is a very cultured country. These happen in mostly the Islamic and the Gulf countries. In India, people think a lot about their reputation in society, and even the society takes care of its members and their wellbeing.

And what I say is true, 'coz I am am an INDIAN. Here, the entire lives of people is dedicated to taking care of thein children. Those who have such habits, are simply boycoted.

I'm very sorry for your difficulties. Forget the "tricks". It might be helpful to try getting real help from someone you know and trust. I know there are those who feel strongly for and against using medications, therapy etc, but I am not going to advise you on that. What I can suggest is that you try building a very rigid daily routine. Write it down, then follow it. Start with the first part of your day, if that's easier, then gradually add to it. Remember too that it takes about three weeks for most people to effectively build a habit. Best of luck.

Is 3 the standard deviation or the variance? Since X1, X2, and X3 are all nromal and independent, then \n\nX1 + X2 + X3 ~ N(0+0+0 = 0, sqrt(3^2+3^2+3^2) = sqrt(27)), if 3 was the SD.\nN(0, 3+3+3 = 9) if 3 was the variance.\n\nIn general, if X_i ~ N(mu_i, sigma_i), where sigma_i is the SD, then the sum of X_i ~ N(sum mu_i, sqrt(sum (sigma_i)^2)).\n\nSince the mean of your distribution is 0, then P(X1+X2+X3>0) = 0.5. Remember that the mean splits the normal distribution in half.
Yes. Yes they are.
the faster the streams velocity is, the quicker the erosion takes place. this is caused by increased friction as velocity increases.\n\nit's sort of like falling from a plane. you go faster and faster, and as your velocity increases, so does the friction. soon, you'll hit terminal velocity, or the point where you are no longer accelerating. the force of friction with the air eventually will equal out with the force of you falling, but still, as you get going faster there is more friction.\n\nthis friction causes the erosion and so the faster the velocity the more the rocks, soil, etc. erodes.

It makes no difference whatsoever, if homosexuality is inborn or chosen. Whatever the reason for the desire may be, it doesn't matter. The desire has never been the issue. The issue is what any given homosexual chooses to do about that desire. Does he choose to follow it, and have sex with members of the same gender, or does he not? The desire can't be helped, but the actions certainly can. He (or she) has no less of an obligation to live a Christian lifestyle than anyone else does, and that includes all aspects of sex as much as it does anything else. It might be harder for them in that way, but it's no less necessary. That can't be watered down.

Let me start by appologizing to you if what follows is insulting. I am trying to be completely honest and helpful.\n\nAre there any banks which will floorplan your start-up used car lot? Yes but ... Many banks do not like to make floorplan loans because they are inherently risky (collateral by its nature is mobile and tends to disappear). Many banks do not like to lend to start-up businesses because they do not have a history of success. Many banks do not like to lend money to independent used car lots because they can be shady. That said, I suspect you might have a hard time finding a floorplan line of credit for a start-up independent used car lot.\n\nI might suggest a loan company as opposed to a bank. Be prepared to sign the loan personally and possibly mortgage your home as additional collateral.

In this instace, lore almost interects with science. Turkey does contain Tryptophan, an amino acid which is a natural sedative. But trytophan doesn't act on the brian unless it is taken on an empty stomach with no protein present, and the amount eaten even during a holiday feast is generally too small to have an appreciable effect. That lazy, lethargic feeling so many are overcome by at the conclusion of a festive season meal is most likey due to the combination of drinking alcohol and over eating a carbohydrate-rich repast, as well as some other factors.
fess up to the mistake and chalk it up to experience. 20 yrs from today you'll never know the difference. the deal to deal with now is the correction of the problem, not ponder over spilt milk. you mom should be able to co-sign for you at the bank for an overdraft acct. and cover the losses and pay the bank or your mom off in quick smaller pmts so not to kill anyone off and press on to bigger and better things...like life and the love of a mother for her daughter and visa versa.\nif that doesn't work...let me know, i'll pull something out of my bag of tricks.\nluck
Turquoise this is the color,,, but in eyes it is different:\nBlue-Green eyes\n \nBlue-green eyes, here with a yellow ring around the pupil, may appear to change colorA variant of blue eyes, blue-green eyes are quite rare and usually consist of an iris with a predominantly blue color, usually darker blue, with green streaks or stippling caused by a yellow- or copper-colored overlay. Yellow-, amber-, or copper-colored rings are often present around the pupil.\n\nThe exact color is often perceived to vary according to its surroundings. Wearing lighter blue colors or getting tanned tends to emphasize the blue components. Wearing bright red, green, and shades of yellow or brown can emphasize green components, or even give the impression of grey\n A hazel eye is not the case:Hazel is usually used to describe eyes that contain elements of both green eyes and brown eyes, sometimes transitioning from green at the edges to brown around the pupil. This should not be confused with irises that display a brown, yellow, or copper-colored ring around the pupil, as in the grey iris shown below.\n\nSo i think ur eyes color is BLUE GREEN

It could be glass (or amorphous solid) which is considered to be a state or phase between solid and liquid.\n\nIf you're looking for something beyond plasma, that question gets pretty tricky to answer because it's quite subjective. You've got quark-gluon plasma, superfluids and loads of other stuff. Some of them haven't existed since the big bang. Some are theoretical. A lot depends on how you define state so take yer pick!\n\nBy the way, contrary to what the answer above says, carbon dioxide can form a liquid phase; just not at atmospheric pressure. At high pressure (over 5 atmospheres) it will form a liquid phase. This to do with triple points and all that sort of thing.\n\nEDIT: a triple point is where gas, liquid and solid phases exist in thermodynamic equilibrium. Triple points are part of a phase diagram and phase diagrams describe how a substance's phases behave under different conditions. \n\nWater's triple point occurs at 0.01 C, 0.006 atm. It definitely does not form a super critical fluid under those conditions. Are you sure you're not confusing the triple point and the CRITICAL POINT (which is where liquid and gas cannot be distinguished: this is the start of the super critical region)?\n\nDon't believe me? Check the links. The last one is for some lozenges for that nasty cough you've picked up ;) ...

$12k for 80 more hp is a huge waste of money. First, that is an improvment in hp of about 13% over stock which you probably wouldn't be able to actually feel and which you could probably gte by doing some simple bolt on modifications like intake, exhaust, new spark plugs, a chip, etc. which would cost far less than $12K.\nIf you want to retain your warranty and the driveability/comfort you desire (especially if you bought an SL65) then you wouldn't necessarily do anything to modify it.\nAlso, a mustang would have to be dramatically modified to get into the 8s in 1/4 and I doubt that any of those mustangs in the 8s are actually street legal. \nIf you thought that the SL65 would be the fastest car ever than you may be a little confused. If you want an 8 second car then you should sell the SL and get a mustang and modify it. I would guarantee that it won't have the comfort, driveability and sophistication of the SL. Personally, as a daily driver I would much rather have the SL than the mustang.

When I was a young woman, although it did matter to me that a potential be pleasant looking, the most important thing was that he be good company, be reliable, and be willing AND able to provide a nest for our future children. Now that I am older, and my children nearly grown and gone, the good company factor is more important than it was, and knowing that I can count on my mate to care for me no matter what has become more important. Kindness and good moral character is as important now as it ever was: I want a man I can trust, who will keep his word. And of course he has to know me well, and love me anyway! lol

Well it would be good to know what Subject you are writing it for? ex. English, history, etc.. but no matter what essay you are righting about you should do a PRO and CON essay write why its wrong and why its right. there is a good an bad in everything. in college its they like pro and con essay's. if i had to pick something to write about it would be something a believe in subjects like Abortion, gay marriage rights there are many things.. drugs, why people do stupid things when there drunk or on drugs. essays on people or historical places. something you don't believe in or do believe in but you can write both sides why you think its right and how you can see why others think its wrong. Good luck i hope you get an A+.
You just have to get up and do it. Be a "do something" and not a "do nothing." Even if that something seems trivial in achieving your ultimate goal, it gets you closer than doing nothing!

It won't be built directly on the border. It will be built slightly inside the US territory. So I doubt illegals will be hired. In fact, they will sub-contract it out to a Haliburton subsidiary and we will pay $50 / hour plus $100 per diem for guys to stand around and watch the one illegall *they* hired to build the wall.\n\nAnd currenly, the border is the Rio Grande River. Mexico diverted it a bit. A park the US had built on the river's edge became Mexican property because the new route for the river put the park on the southern side of the river.
I can remember back to when I was about 8 months old. but also have slight memories of when I was really little and couldnt even talk. Those memories are more like feelings than actual thoughts though !!\n\nI remember my dad and my cousins playing scaletrix in a house we moved out of when I was 2yrs old.\n\nI also remember climbing a ladder of a 2 storey extension when my dad was on the roof at the same house ( that gave him a freight )\n\nI was a in the times newspaper from about 3 months old ( mum being a professional photographer )\n\nI remember climbing out of my crib at the child minders and freeing all the other kids that couldnt climb out.\n\nI remember getting my hand trapped in the hinge of the old red phone box's in gunnerside in Yorkshire. My mum didnt know which way to open or close it to get my little hand out with out cutting it off.\n\nAlso got my hand caught in the lock of the old carriages between charing cross and waterloo east. Again mum didnt want to open the door incase I fell out!!\n\nBut above all I remember seeing a clown and being so scared and disturbed by it that even to this day I cant stand them.

Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, that, if untreated, causes mental retardation, physical disabilities and death. First described as a disease in 1954, it is a rare disorder, believed to be in all ethnic groups worldwide. The national incidence is 1 in 225,000 births. \n\nMSUD derives its name from the sweet, burnt sugar, or maple syrup smell of the urine. The disorder affects the way the body metabolizes (processes) certain components of protein. Amino acids accumulate in the blood causing a toxic effect that interferes with brain functions. The symptoms of classic MSUD are usually evident within the first week of life. The first symptoms in an infant are poor appetite, irritability, and the characteristic odor of the urine. Within days they lose their sucking reflex and grow listless, have a high-pitched cry, and become limp with episodes of rigidity. Without diagnosis and treatment, symptoms progress rapidly to seizures, coma, and death. In some variant types, failure to thrive may be the first sign. The earlier these children are diagnosed and treated, the less risk of permanent damage.\n\nTreatment of children with MSUD must be started as soon as possible, preferably at birth. It involves a complex approach of maintaining metabolic control. A special, carefully controlled diet is the focus of daily treatment. This requires careful monitoring of protein intake and close medical supervision. The diet centers around a synthetic formula or "medical food" which provides nutrients and all the amino acids except leucine, isoleucine and valine. These three amino acids are added to the diet with carefully controlled amounts of food to provide the protein necessary for normal growth and development without exceeding the level of tolerance. \nVarious tests are available to monitor the levels of the amino acids and their keto acid derivatives in the blood and urine. Illnesses and stress, as well as consuming too much protein, raise these levels. Even mild illnesses can become life‑threatening. A metabolic imbalance requires dietary changes and at times hospitalization.
Emotional highs and lows are part of life for everyone. But for someone with bipolar disorder, these ups and downs can be so extreme they can interfere with daily life. Sometimes they can even be dangerous. \n\nOne day a person with bipolar disorder may feel so depressed that they can't get out of bed. Work may seem impossible. \n\nOn another day that person may feel great, full of endless energy and creativity. But other people might think that their actions are reckless and out of control. \n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong medical condition that can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Learning more about bipolar disorder can be helpful in managing this medical illness. \n\nThere are four main types of bipolar disorder: \nBipolar I Disorder \nBipolar II Disorder \nCyclothymic Disorder \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \n\n\nBipolar I Disorder - Bipolar I disorder involves one or more manic or mixed episodes, and often one or more major depressive episodes. A depressive episode may last for several weeks or months. Between episodes of bipolar I disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n\nBipolar II Disorder - Bipolar II disorder involves one or more major depressive episodes along with at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less severe. Between episodes of bipolar II disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n \nCyclothymic Disorder - Cyclothymic disorder is a long-term fluctuating mood disturbance with periods of hypomania and periods of depression. It is a milder form of bipolar disorder. That's because the periods of both depression and hypomania are shorter, less severe, and do not occur with regularity.\n \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - This type of bipolar disorder is when the person does not fit into the types of bipolar disorder mentioned above. The experiences of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. Just like the other types of bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is treatable.
You should know by now, how dense we men are at those things. Sad to say it's one of our many failings.\nAt least he didn't forget the Birthday entirely, just the actual date, so it could have been worse.\nAnd you do mean a lot to him, he did remember the week of your birthday, and called you to make sure, he got the right date.\nIf he didn't care for you, would he have even bothered to ask.\nMen can remember who won the world series, in 1902 or whatever year, but birthday's anniversaries, etc, just don't stick.\nSadly as I said, that is just a guy thing.\nSo cut him some slack for forgetting the actual day, and making sure, he didn't miss it all together. \nI'm sure he'll get you a great gift and give you a great night to go along with it.
The deity Muslims worship is referred to in Islam as "Allah", which is really the Arabic word for God (descended from the Aramaic word for god, which translates as "Elah"). \n\nIn reality, Muslims worship the Hebrew god אֶהְיֶה ( and you should read that name from right to left instead of left to right as you would if the name was written in English, since Hebrew is written in the opposite direction).\n\nThe name of the God, should you need a way to pronounce it in English, can roughly be translated as Yahweh, or more loosely as Jehovah. \n\nIt is the same god worshiped as the god of Creation and the Universe in Judaism, and in Christianity as well, since both Islam and Christianity descend from Judaism and are seen as different, updated ways the one true god of the Hebrews has instructed mankind to worship Him (the practical upshot of which is that while all three religions worship the same god, none of the three see the other two as really being valid since, in all three cases, each religion views the other two as being in error about god's will... the Jews because they do not believe either Jesus or Mohammad and their teachings are valid... the Christians because they believe the teachings of Jesus and his interpretations leading to Christianity render the other two invalid, and the Muslims because they believe the teachings of Mohammad and his interpretations leading to Islam do the same).

Yes, your broker is right. However, if you will pay just an extra 50 bucks a month, you will DRASTICALLY lower your principal balance, saving literally thousands of dollars over the life of the loan if you keep it more than a couple of years. Another great way to lower your principal is to split your monthly mortgage payment into 4 WEEKLY payments, this will attack your principal balance quickly. You will want to make sure your lender will accept this type of payment (although they sure won't LIKE it, due to loss of interest on their part).\n\nIt is up to you what type of loan you get. Ask questions to prospective lenders. You shouldn't have to pay interest that hasn't accrued (what you would pay if you went through the entire life of the loan). If that is what they are proposing...LOOK INTO OTHER LENDERS..this is not standard practice. \n\nHomes will normally gain value over time, if kept well. You may not come out ahead a lot over just a few years, but you should have some equity (value) built up.\n\nGood luck....ask questions...no question is dumb.

.50 cal dessert Eagle ammo is different then the standard .50 cal M2 machine Gun. The pistol is a semi automatic weapon capable of firing one round per trigger squeeze. It fires in single and double action. The ammo for the DE is about 1.50 a round. The gun is not very accurate as the bushing tends to go out of them rather quickly due to the recoil force. You can pick one up for anywhere between 350 to 1500 bucks depending on the add ons and optics. You need only the standard permit in order to carry the weapon. You will however need a special range to shoot it at and will end up paying a great deal for the ammunition. If you are an avid shooter i would look into learning how to reload the ammunition this will save you a bundle and will allow you to tailor the grain load for target shooting and self protection.\n\nRobert Henry \nGunners mate

Stock : An instrument that signifies an ownership position (called equity) in a corporation, and represents a claim on its proportional share in the corporation's assets and profits. Ownership in the company is determined by the number of shares a person owns divided by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company has 1000 shares of stock outstanding and a person owns 50 of them, then he/she owns 5% of the company. Most stock also provides voting rights, which give shareholders a proportional vote in certain corporate decisions. Only a certain type of company called a corporation has stock; other types of companies such as sole proprietorships and limited partnerships do not issue stock. also called equity or equity securities or corporate stock.

The Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup playoffs. The winner is chosen by the vote of members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and is not necessarily a member of the Cup-winning team. The vote is conducted during the 2nd period of an elimination game in the Stanley Cup Finals. If the finals is not over in the game, the votes will be discarded and the procedures will be repeated until a Stanley Cup winner is decided. The trophy is handed out prior to the presentation of the Stanley Cup by the commissioner, not during the NHL Awards the following week.\n\nThe trophy was named for the late Conn Smythe (1895-1980), a Hockey Hall of Fame builder and owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and as such, the trophy depicts the old Maple Leaf Gardens...

Every body of mass produces a force of gravity. The larger the body, the more gravity it produces. The sun is large enough to produce enough gravity to pull Earth towards it. However, at the same time, Earth is in motion. The motion would be straight, but because the sun's gravity pulls Earth towards the sun, the Earth's path of motion is curved around the sun. It is like swinging a ball on the end of a string, with gravity acting like an invisible string.

I am starting my 4th year of Medical School at UT San Antonio in Texas. I am lucky because Texas offers its residents the least expensive medical school in the US with tuition and fees of about 11K to 12 K per year. Books, living expenses, etc...all add up of course, but the federal student loan program allows anyone who is willing to live frugally (my budget for living expenses on loans only is about 1500 per month and this is not difficult to do) the ability to borrow all that is necessary to pay for school and live. You will be borrowing probably 150K over the 4 years, but you can consolidate and pay it back over long enough that it is do-able if you really want to do it. \n\nAnother option is the military program. Any branch of the military offers a stipend that will basically give you the same amount of money that loans do per month, pay for tuition, fees and books and in exchange you will pay back year for year to the military. So, you will not be in any debt at all when you complete your time committment to the military. They are recruiting strongly now and allow many things, such as older than usual or past medical histories of some things, that they would not have allowed in the past. This is a good option if you are not comfortable with debt.\n\nAs for how difficult it is to get in my advice is this. When I decided to apply some people laughed at me and said I would never make it because I was a fine arts major and went to a smaller, less than impressive undergraduate school, but I DID get in and if you really want to - you will too. Check the school web sites for necessary prerequisites and time lines to apply, do some volunteer work or work as an orderly or something like that in a hospital - this will prove that you are motivated, and then take the MCAT entrance exam (I HIGHLY recommend a preparation course prior to taking this exam - they are MORE than worth the money). Apply - if you don't get in the first try - go in person to talk with someone in the admissions department at a medical school and talk with them openly about your application. Take their advice and re-apply. We need good doctors. So, if you feel the calling, don't let anything get in your way!

Some exameples are: skateboarding, inline skating, snowboarding, or one of the more extremer sports, such as Moto X, skysurfing and kytesurfing.\n\nExtreme sport (practically synonymous with the term action sport) is a general term for sports featuring speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a so-called ‘‘adrenaline rush’’ in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of dopamine endorphins and serotonin).\n\nExtreme sports are often associated with young adults wishing to push themselves to the limits of their physical ability and fear, in turn pushing the boundaries of a particular sport. This youthful demographic accounts too for extreme sports’ frequent association with youth culture, not restricted to clothing fashions and music.\n\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one is as much to do with marketing as it is to do with perceptions about levels of danger involved or the amount of adrenaline generated. Snowboarding thus has a more extreme ‘‘image’’ than skiing due to differing marketing strategies and the fact of being a newer sport, even though skiing is a faster and at least equally dangerous activity.

I took a class on the Radical Republicans (Reconstruction, actually, but they played a big part in it). Simply put, the South thought of the Radical Republicans as occupants. They took over the Confederate States and ran them as territories: military governors and strict laws. The former slaves considered them saviors. They instituted laws directed at helping out their freedom, to a point. There were a lot of empty promises made by these Republicans, but it is no surprise that almost all former slaves registered as Repulbicans. The north is where most of the Republicans came from.

Actually, the $11,000 limit is the amount above which you have to report the gift to the IRS. If you give below $11,000, you don't even have to tell the IRS you did it. You can do that once each year.\n\nIf you give someone more than $11,000 in any one year, you have to report the amount to the IRS. However, the giver doesn't have to pay taxes on that amount automatically. Instead, the amount is documented and added to any future gifts reported to the IRS. Once that amount hits $1 Million, then the IRS begins taxing it. Before then, nobody gets taxed on the gifts.\n\nThat's why the hubbub over the Estate Tax is such a joke (also called by some politicians the "Death Tax."). How many people do you know that will have $1 Million dollars to give to their heirs when they die (including any value of a home, for example)? I don't know too many. The Estate Tax as it is now written only affects a small percentage of the richest people in the country.\n\nI hope that helps.

No, it was not appropriate for him to announce his disappointment to the American People. He should have kept his personal feelings to himself and publicly supported the outcome. Because he has to work with these people for the next two years and he shouldn't start making waves now.
Well the premise in the tv shows is that the accused officer now has the time and the motivation, and they are further driven by anger and a need to prove their innocence. And yes, it is one of the most over-used plots for cop shows.\n\nIn real life if you tried to follow up on anything especially a case that you were involved in prior to your suspension, you would find yourself in jail for obstruction of justice, or stalking the witness/suspects who got you in trouble in the first place. Additionally, you could be charged with carrying a concealed weapon, since you wouldn't have the right to do so off duty. Also, when you hand in your badge, even if it is for a suspension, you are told you have no police powers, so if you pulled a gun on someone or took them into custody or even said "I am Officer (or Detective) _______" you could be charged with impersonating a police officer. \nInternal Affairs may also assign a detective to keep an eye on you and make sure that you don't try to follow-up on anything and that if you do, they are there to put a stop to it and take you into custody. \nFinally, if the real criminal is someone in public office, what usually happens is the accused officer (or his attorney) can use the press to bring that person down. \n\nNow, what sometimes happens in "real life" to good cops who are falsely accused is:\nThey wait until their suspension is over, they gather up all the evidence possible, they either retire or leave the department, and then they write a book about what really happened. \nOr, if they are fired, they can write about it right away, unless there is some type order that stays in effect after the incident.\nOr, they can personally sue the public official or executive for damages, prove their innocence in civil court and get a nice fat settlement, then go on to write the book.\nMaking money from the incident can be far more satisfying than putting the executive or public official in jail.

Yes and no. I can forgive people for things they've done to me, and they can do likewise. \n\nBut if you're asking whether humans can take away someone's guilt by forgiving them, then no. When we sin against someone, we also sin against God, because we're rebelling against the way He made us. So only God can forgive us and take away our guilt.\n\nIs this what you were asking? If not, let me know.

This is only a partial responce to your question and partly a responce to the idiots who ansewred before me.\n\nA true American is a person born under the legal qualifications of citizenship as determined by the U.S. Constitution. It says if you are born to a U.S. Citizen or on U.S. soil, you are a natural citizen. If you studied hard and folloewd the imigration laws and rules, you can be naturalized and be a citized too.\n\nA "Native American" is any person born on U.S. soil to U.S. citizen parents.\n\nAn modern American Indian is a decendant of those Asians who migrated across the Bering Straight land bridge.\n\nAll settlers who came here before there was a country came here legally because, according to the American Indian Tribes, "No man owned the land".\n\nIf somebody were to break into your house and demand you feed them, you'd kick them out. That's what Illegal immigrants did.\n\nIf you wait in line at the bank for 30 minutes and some guy comes in and cuts infront of your, you'd send him to the end of the line. That's what Illegal Immigrants did to the Legal immigrants.\n\nThis country may need immigrants, since out current birthrate is too low to support our needs, but why not let the Legal immigrant who has been waiting for 10 years to get the job? This is not a racial thing.\n\nAnybody who takes off work or school to march on May 1st doesn't need their job or their education (or doesn't want it) and their dismissal from work or suspension from school is appropriate.\n\nIf all the Mexicans who are here illegally (over 10 million) were to march on Mexico City demanding to have better jobs, economy, and living conditions, Presidente Fox would run for his life.\n\nRemember, Mexico requires Identification to get jobs and shoots anybody sneeking in their country illegally.

It does depend a little on how young we are talking about - a 5 year old is not going to understand some of the more sublte triggers and points that perhaps a 14 year old might\n\nIf you are a victim to racism, then unless you want the youngster to "be a victim" try and make them realise that there will ALWAYS be people who have a problem with someones colour , religion, gender, sexuality etc and race is no different. Try to make them realise it is nothing to do with them, more a hangup belongin to someone else.\n\nIf you hear them making slurs and are racist, then presumably you would be impressed. Sad but there ya go. If you are not overly impressed, then rather than jump down their throats, try to find out what made them make the comments, see if you can get them to explain their attitude. Do they have a reason - is it peer pressure ?\n\nIf you don't approve of racism, then above applies really, try and deal with it with them in a realistic and honest way - but do not add your own personal thoughts grudges and hang-ups to the pot if you can help it.\n\nIf you are racist, then I guess you will encourage your child to carry on the hate for another generation. Seems a bit of a cruel thing to do but there ya go.\n\n\nps:\n\nMizogen, your story about the Jewish father is powerful and I have heard it before. But although very quotable, I think there is a danger f being too cynical in life.\n\nI would far rather be taken for a mug once in a blue-moon - and accept that some folks are decent human beings - than make sure I distrust everyone at all time no matter what.\n\nTelling a child he should epxect no good from any man is a pretty good way of crippling his/her social skills from day one. My guess is that if you follow your own advice, you are perhaps someone who "enjoys their own company" a great deal of the time. do you really wish such a friendless, loveless life for your kids too?

take a step back from the "moving to IST." bit. Maybe go visit, after you establish your relationship again. You should meet and visit there before you just decide to move there. Talk to him for a while and see where he is really.
Have him write a will....spell it all out, get who gets what in black and white and with lawyer's keen eye if possible. Moreover, talk to the spouse, have him explain his reasoning so that later on she won't come back wanting it all coz of miscommunication. Is this a bad relationship? Or does he just want to provide for you and your siblings? If she is kept in the loop, she may be more responsive. My grandparents had a family meeting when my grandmother was dying. They put in no uncertain terms that no property was taken from the house til grandpa passed as well (to keep him from feeling useless or forgotten). Everything was laid out as to whom things were to go and what things were to be sold or donated for charity. My father was made executor (after a family vote), because it was agreed he'd be most likely to insure all wishes were met as my grandparents wished, not their soon-to-be grieving and emotionally unstable children.
The Wolverine's\n\nWe are noted for the following traits: \n\nStanding Our Ground \nFierceness \nElusiveness \nCleverness \nStrength \nEndurance \nCourage \n\nReal wolverines are so badass the football team can't even have the real ones on the side line in cages \n\nIn 1927, 10 wolverines were obtained from Alaska and placed in the Detroit Zoo. On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states, " It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly." Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead "Biff" was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \n\n\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\n\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\n\nThe Spartans.... Sparta was the queen the ancient city was named after, her husband was the name of the whole territory. Do you really want to be thought of as someones little sister?...lol

Hello Catherine, Your question is a very good one.Now,in the first molecule OF 2, all the valence electrons are used up in bonding and it forms a stable molecule having linear geometry. In the second molecule SCL 2 the same is happening and the molecule is linear in geometry.But, in the last one that is PF 5, the three valence electrons of Phosphorus are used up in bonding with Fluorine electrons,leaving two electrons of Phosphorus as Lone-pairs,as a result the molecule has a distorted geometry and the molecule has a Pyramidral shape like that of NH 3. I think I can able to make you understand.Bye.

My understanding of the law is that you are allowed to make a backup copy of a DVD that you make. For example a DVD movie of you and your friend. \n\nYou are not allowed under the law to buy a DVD of a Hollywood movie and then back it up to your Hard drive. \n\nFor example in the united States you are allowed to buy a Music CD and rip it into a MP3 file on your computer yet for movies this is not allowed. \n\nI was watching a episode #1 of on confused Nerd TV and they were talking about this exact situation.\n\nHere is a copy of conversation they were having.\n\nBandwidth is not decreasing, you know. It's an incredible lesson, when I first put my server together over six years ago it was a little bit of a strain. It could barely compress things in real time. Now I stick a CD in there and get it all ripped and compressed in under five minutes. It's just little corner of most people's hard disks. So the next things are the movies, which have an order of magnitude size of information, so I've started doing those as well. I put together a movie server for myself that now has over 500 works on it.\nBob: Really?\nAndy: It's illegal, because one of the worst laws I'm aware of, the DMCA says that even though I buy the DVD I can't copy it onto my computer.\nBob: I forgot you are a criminal.\nAndy: I'm a criminal in more ways than one.\nBob: Our new Attorney-General will be watching this.\n\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/transcripts/001.html\n\nYou can watch episode #1 here.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/

Its always hard to tell someone you like them. But if you really like this person, you should do something sweet to tell her. It always gets to them. If you know what she likes, then try to make something with that. Like say for example many girls like flowers. A friend of mine that liked somone asked me how to tell this girl he liked that he liked her. I told him since at the time that we were selling carnations, that he should buy her some and send her a poem. It worked! She said yes and everything is fine. So doing something sweet would sure be something to try.
Your local newspaper has an community calender listing with lots of non profit groups and organizations listed. (they probably have a website too.) Also, local radio stations are constantly talking about opportunities to volunteer for a variety of civic activitities. Drop by your Chamber of Commerce office and pick up some info about your community.\nYou might consider joing an organization. Not sure how old you are, but I know that there are organizations for every age that can keep you busy doing great things for your community. Being Civic minded will do more for you than just building character and helping you meet a lot of great people, it always looks great on your resume...but..do it cuz it's fun! Good luck!
I don't think either person is better or worse. They both have good/bad traits. Of course, being married to Brad Pitt and then losing him to Angelina wasn't fun. But you know I always believe if it was meant to be, it will be. You cannot force people to stay in a marriage if they don't want to. So life gives you some kinks, you have to learn to live with it. Jennifer Anniston is living her life now with a better attitude. So maybe Angelina helped her find herself. But everything takes time. There's no right answer. Everyone is human and everyone has their own faults. So don't throw insults when you actually don't know what is involved in their life.

Thoreau left the woods because he felt like he spent too much time lamenting the world's problems and not enough fixing them.\n\nBackground info: Emerson was Thoureau's hero. Emerson taught everything that Thoreau believed (mainly Transcendentalism and a mix b/w anarchy and true communism-not Chinese communism). However, Thoureau discovered that Emerson was a hipocrite- he didn't practice what he preached- and he (Thoreau) decided that he didn't want to be known as a hipocrite. Unfortunately, Thoureau's circle of influence was much smaller than Emerson's, so he didn't do a whole lot to change the world. \n\nThoreou wanted to live in the woods because he wanted to live "deliberately" and simply. Here is a quote from his essay "Where I Lived and What I Lived For" :\n "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."\n\nI hope this helped- I'm studying Thoreau right now too- so I'm not exactly an expert, you should try reading "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail"- it will either make things clearer for you, or confuse you even more.

The President of the United States of America (often abbreviated to "POTUS") is the head of state of the United States. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\n\nBecause of the superpower status of the United States, the American President is widely considered to be the most powerful person on the earth, and is usually one of the world's best-known public figures. During the Cold War, the President was sometimes referred to as "the leader of the free world," a phrase that is still invoked today.\n\nPowers and Dueties of the President of the United States \nThe President, according to the Constitution, must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." To carry out this responsibility, the president presides over the executive branch of the federal government; a vast organization of about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. A President-elect will make as many as 6,000 appointments to government positions, including appointments to the federal judiciary. The Senate must consent to all judicial appointments as well as the appointments of all principal officers. The President may veto laws made by the United States Congress but cannot personally initiate laws. Congress can overturn the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. He is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and may make treaties, but the Senate must confirm these. The political scientist Richard Neustadt said, "Presidential power is the power to persuade and the power to persuade is the ability to bargain". He was commenting on the fact that the President's domestically constitutional power is limited, despite the modern expectation of Presidents to have a legislative program, and successful bargaining with Congress is usually essential to Presidential success.\n\nas for perks well that would be Command, Salary, Service, Meting People, & Fullfillmetn of Goals Set
Hey! Girl,\n\nIt would be advisable to keep in touch and set a schedule where one would visit the other and vice versa. \n\nBased on my experience back in my college days, I've been dating my ex bf for 5 years since 3rd year high, and when I went to College which is 1 1/2 hour drive from home and stayed in the dorm, we haven't seen each other for quite a while, he sometimes visits me but not so often as he goes to college too or I will go home and have time to visit him. Since my interest changes due to my college experience with my new found friends in the exclusive school for girls, our communication was not quite as often as before. I discovered that he was seeing another girl. After a few years, that relationship didn't even last, until I went abroad to work. After a few years, I came back on a holiday and happen to meet him again but he's already married to someone else. But we're still friends, and we still belong to our circle of friends since high school. I have no regrets for moving on to college, staying in the dorm or going abroad. I improved myself. I keep meeting new friends and sometimes a new boyfriend, but that's just it. Relationship is good while it lasts, it gives me joy and inspiration. \n\nI suggest that you move on with your life and embrace the new experience while you still have your boyfriend at heart. Develop yourself and improve yourself, it's for your own self worth. If he would have time to see you, it means he's committed to you. But if the schedule is kind of hectic at times, keep yourself busy. Don't worry about it, you're still young.\n\nTake care.\n\nMitch

b) Why there are four masses here 1 small guy + 3 big guy = 4. Divide 4 into 20, you get 5. But that is only half the answer. The big guy's mass is an anchor for the small guy. So every time the big guy pulls he just pulling the small guy closer and every time the small guy pulls he is moving closer in a ratio of 3 to 1. So the big guy only moves 5m and the small guy move 15m.
premature ejaculation. if it is not used alot he may become stimulated too fast. if he would like to prolong the use of his love pole, he needs to use it more and practice long stimulation.\n\nPremature ejaculation, also known as rapid ejaculation, or by the Latin term ejaculatio praecox, is the most common sexual problem in men, characterized by a lack of voluntary control over ejaculation. Masters and Johnson stated that a man suffers from premature ejaculation if he ejaculates before his partner achieves orgasm in more than fifty percent of his sexual encounters. Other sex researchers have defined premature ejaculation as occurring if the man ejaculates within two minutes of penetration; however, a survey by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s demonstrated that three quarters of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration in over half of their sexual encounters. Today, most sex therapists understand premature ejaculation as occurring when a lack of ejaculatory control interferes with sexual or emotional well-being in one or both partners. An estimated thirty percent of men suffer from premature ejaculation on a consistent basis.
TELL HIM.... I was in the same boat with a girl I knew many years ago.... I fell in love with her as a friend..... then, as we got closer and closer... I fell in love with her completely... and I knew she cared about me but, neither of us every told each other how we truly felt.... though we stayed friends.. I ended up moving away and we didn't keep in touch often enough.. next thing I knew.. she met a guy and they got married... I told her several years later after she'd had two children... she told me she was in love with me but didn't think I liked her that way.\nShe would have married me... I would have married her... but we didn't tell each other how we felt until it was too late. We're still friends.. but we don't see each other now because I think we both know what would happen.\n\nDon't wait until it's completely too late... tell him now.... if your friendship is powerful.... it'll remain that way regardless... if he feels the same way... maybe his 'current' relationship will end and he'll be with you.... but if you don't tell him, you'll regret it for the rest of your life and will always want to know.....\n\nI hope it works out for you!

Your body releases chemicals that are very similar to tweak (as in speed or crystal meth). So you lose your apatite and feel a bit jittery. \nBut then when that all wears off, if the girl is still as great as when you first started falling in love with her, the magic happens. You feel like you are only really complete when you are together. Like part of you is missing when she isn't there. You know you would do anything to save her from a burning building (or any other threatening situation) even if you know it would kill you. \nI have done lots of things like rock climbing, jumping out of airplanes and driving 140 mph in a 65 zone, but nothing compares to the feeling I get when I look at my wife.

Don't call him. Let him come get in touch with you.\n\nDo not wait around for him for a long while, either, miss. If he does not have the courtesy, decency, and maturity to speak with you about whatever may be troubling him about the current relationship situation, then honestly, you are better off without him. I know that sounds cold, but I feel that you will find it to be quite accurate later on.\n\nBest of luck. If he wants you, he'll call you. If not - brush yourself off, and find a guy who has good sense and enough maturity to talk to you about such matters.
Studies using xylitol as either a sugar substitute or a small dietary addition have demonstrated a dramatic reduction in new tooth decay, along with arrest and even some reversal of existing dental caries. Xylitol provides additional protection that enhances all existing prevention methods. This xylitol effect is long-lasting and possibly permanent. Low decay rates persist even years after the trials have been completed.

But... it isn't. I assume, from your reference to truth tables, that you're referring to boolean algebra, so you're asking me to show that A and B = A xor B. It isn't. In fact , A * B implies ¬A+B, and vice versa.\n\nEdit: Um... dualspace, what about A=5/4 and B=5? Or A=2 and B=2? Or in general:\nab=a+b\n(b-1)a=b\na=b/(b-1)\nAlthough, as mentioned above, that's not what he's talking about.

Might want to try, whatever business you're going into, to go into a more entry-level type job even if it means taking a hit in pay.

Forget the books, you need to get rid of this guy. I don't neccessarily perscribe to the idea of "once a cheater always a cheater," but in this case your husband is still talking to this other woman. It really doesn't matter if they're arguing when they talk..point is..he's not respecting you and your relationship enough to let this other woman go. Instead of reading books on how to make him stop cheating, start reading books on how to love and respect yourself. You may find your eyes open quite a bit when you realize how much you're worth!
The season finale is May 18th: It's entitled, "The Graduates".\n\nSUMMARY OF EPISODE 21 entitled “The Dawn Patrol”\nAired: 4/13/06:\n\nIt’s dinner time at the Cohen household. Ryan and Seth whisper conspiratorially about the wisdom of Seth lying to Summer about Brown. Seth still stands behind his decision, but not so much that he wants to tell his parents about it. Kirsten mentions that tickets for graduation have come in, and Ryan suggests giving his to the Nana since he won’t be needing them. Kirsten thinks Ryan should maybe invite his mom. Ryan thinks maybe he should avoid the topic and hope it just goes away.\n\nLater, Kirsten drops in on the pool house, apologizing for making Ryan uncomfortable. But Ryan is actually aware of the reality of the situation. This could be his last chance to see his mom. So it’s off to Albuquerque. \n\nWhen Marissa gets out of the shower the next morning, Volchok is waiting in her bedroom. And he’s ready to get her out of that robe and get it on. But that will have to wait, because Julie’s in the doorway and she already doesn’t like Volchok. It’s cool. Volchok doesn’t have to stick around for this. Julie tells Marissa no more Volchok, which is usually just the impetus Marissa needs to do something. If anything, Julie should’ve told Marissa to marry Volchok. Then she would’ve dumped him before lunch.\n\nAt harbor, Summer glumly shuffles around the student lounge. Seth watches her longingly from a distance, but doesn’t say anything. Taylor takes in the scene and then joins Summer at her table. But not matter what optimistic viewpoint Taylor has to share, Summer doesn’t want to hear it. She’d rather rant and rave about what Seth did to her. She can’t figure it out either, because she’s gotten even hotter this year and there’s no way a guy like Seth could walk away from her unless he was hiding something. And she’s determined to get to the bottom of it. \n\nMatt’s enjoying a morning cocktail at the yacht club when Sandy arrives for a meeting they’d planned. Matt hands Sandy a projection of calculated future earnings, with a little pain and suffering cash thrown in. Either Matt gets his money from Griffin or he tells the DA about the documents he has on Griffin. Sandy realizes he’s being blackmailed for the second time in a week.\n\nMarissa drops by Volchok’s ultra cool loft to hang out. At the same time, Ryan arrives at a small diner in Albuquerque looking for his mother. But her shift doesn’t start for a couple of hours. He’ll be back. Dawn’s young coworker, Chloe, is more than pleased to see somebody as cute as Ryan show up. Hopefully she has a troubled past, or else Ryan just won’t be into her. \n\nMeanwhile, in calculus class, Summer frantically tries to get Seth’s attention. She then bursts out laughing and explains to the annoyed teacher that Seth’s dead-on impersonation of the teacher’s penguin walk was cracking her up. The teacher gives them both weekend detention. In the hallway, Summer explains that she broke up with him, she has the power to revoke said breakup. Which she is doing until he can sufficiently explain what his deal is lately. She kisses him and then reports to Dr. Kim’s office. Seth is slightly confused, to say the least.\n\nAfter nightfall, Ryan heads back to the diner. He sees his mom slinging club sandwiches and flirting with a biker and decides he’d rather not go in. But when he turns to leave, Chloe asks where he’s going. And if he’s not going inside, would he like to go somewhere with her? Indeed he would. \n\nJust then, Marissa and Volchok are about to go downtown when there’s a knock at the door. From outside, Julie calls out for Marissa. Marissa hides as Volchok lets Julie in. Julie explains to Volchok that’s he just one in a long line of Marissa’s phases, and it’s inevitable that she’ll wise up one day and leave him in the dust. Marissa overhears the entire conversation.\n
Of course. I am a chemical engineer and you just need to get out into the country to see how great this planet still is.
I think you and your cousin need to go to therapy because there is something just a little wrong about sleeping together in any manner of the word. You need to go out and find a real love interest and not worry about your cousin, she needs to go look for someone across town, not across the hall. That's just skeezy.
Okay, let's see... I was 13 when I had my first "non-car" date - my mom drove us to the movies with some other kids. At 16, I had my first "car" date - he took me out to dinner. I was married at 21, and I'm still married 20+ years later (happily, thanks).\n\nShould? Hmm. I think it worked out about right, for me - but it's a matter of how mature the parties are (some kids are old enough for a group date at 13, others you can't trust to be sensible until later). Marriage - well, I'd say teenagers are almost always not ready, but after 20, again, it depends on the couple - how mature, how committed, how ready to do what it takes to have a successful, lasting relationship.
I watched it a long time ago... but I remember I liked Flowers For Algernon (book) better.
make a POINT\n\ngive EVIDENCE for making that point\n\nEXPLAIN it
It seems a necessary hypothesis to resolve the paradox of two different concepts. On the one hand, we believe in a God who is good and plays fair. On the other hand, we observe that some good people have rotten luck and some bad people have great luck. Some people can resolve it by postulating a heavan and hell which will, somehow, even the score. But hell sounds too final and awful for people who are only moderately on the negative side, and heavan too good for those only moderately on the positive side. Some people solve that one by postulating some sort of custom-tailored heavan/hell idea. To me, reincarnation is an easier answer.\n\nIf I believe in a God which is smarter and more subtle than all of us, I can believe in a chance for me to come back as a beautiful, intelligent and wealthy young lady. That's the only way to make up for all the rotten luck I have suffered in the current incarnation!

I generally wait a few days between shaves - makes it less irritative. I also use a facial scrub the night before I shave - it smooths the skin and makes your razor glide better. \n\nI generally shave up the way, which you shouldn't really do, but the hair under my chin is quite thick and downwards shaving doesn't give me a very close shave.\n\nI use Gillette shaving gel (which foams up) and a Mach 3. Afterwards I have Clinique after shave cream stuff that is amazing. Expensive, but worth it.
During my first year in college, my interest in Science was broadened. (How?) There were activities that gave me a brief introduction to the course I'm pursuing (which is?)like the experiments that we conducted in our Chemistry class and the dissection of frog in our Zoology. The introduction of First Aid (should it be aid or aide?) gave me a more brief (why more brief, I think you should reconsider this statement) idea on the work of a nurse and it was very useful (from here on out this sentence is not clear) in times especially when one of my family members needed it most. (New paragraph) As I turned into second year college, I was introduced to new subjects namely Nutrition, Science Technology and Society and Health Economics which gave me a wider interest in the course that I am taking. Our class did a community service and conducted surveys in our Civic Welfare Training Service Program, and from that experience I learned that it is (very sounds over the top here) very heartwaming to listen and assist in the problems of other people. I am happy to provide comfort and help to the troubled and diseased ones. (those who are troubled and sick sounds better and sick does not have the negative connotations that diseased has)\n\nI usually read Science and Health related books and magazines during my free time and I'm very fond of watching educational shows (if you keep the word "shows" name specific shows not channels) like Discovery Channel (and should not be capitolized) And National Geographic Channel. Badminton is the sport that I play and I also go to the gym once in a while. Scrabble is my favorite board game. My household responsibilities, other than doing chores, include helping my younger brother and cousin in their studies. (This whole last paragraph is not useful in determining whether or not to admit you to graduate school)\n\nIt needs to be longer and sound more professional. At this point it does not sound as if you know anything about the profession for which you are training. Throw in some jargon from the field. Remember your audience, you are writing to other professionals, not laypeople. Tell why you have selected their program and what you'll bring to the program. Tell about research interests. Tell about personal strengths and weaknesses you have that are relevent to the field. Sorry if I am being harsh, but I am not long past having to write one myself and know what's what.

Everyone above is correct, except I do believe that the black hole itself does have infinite gravity (that's the reason the light cannot escape...) because the warping of space-time is infinite at the point of infinite density.
The unknown is always scary. Something took a wrong turn 15 years ago, and you haven't been on track since then. You probably feel like your all alone in the woods now. So prepare yourself mentally to leave so you can physically leave or fix this! You have 2 choices. 38 years is a long time. I believe the magic that brought you two together is still alive, although it may seem like a candle in the sun. If either one of you had wanted to really end this, one of you would be long gone. But your both still co-excisting in the same home. First, find yourselve again. If your job can't support you if you should decide to leave, use this time to find another job. Keep in mind, he is going to have to 1/2 things with you. So your probably going to be alright financially from the divorce settlement, if you go this route. Next you need friends. Don't sit at that house wondering what he is doing 8 to 10 hours on a daily basis. That is 8 to 10 hours that you have, to do anything you want. This is all about you now. You can't make him be happy. You can't make him come home after work, and probably really don't want to at this point. Stop doing the norm!!! Never ask him again, where he has been. You no longer care. You are mentally prepping yourself for a better life. Now, keep in mind, once you are centered, he is going to notice the difference. They always do. At this point, you can try and rekindle or you continue to move ahead with your mental plan. What ever it is you decide to do, just get started on it as soon as possible. Woman, you are in the prime of your life! You have a lot to offer someone that will appreciate you. People live so much longer these days, and happy people make living longer even better. You come out of that house, re-enter the world of the living, get with friends, go to dinner, shopping, or take a singles vacation. Whatever it is, just do it! After about 6 months from now, you are going to be a new person. You are going to be a happier person. You are going to be alive and enjoying new things. You just refocus from who you where, and turn it around to who you want to be. You are going to be living each day for you. And if your husband wants to be apart of all this wonderful stuff, he can mentally change just like you are going to. If he is not a part of this plan, that is OK to, because in time you will mentally know you can carry on with out him. Good Luck, and God bless you and your determination.

The universe is not a vacuum since it obviously has stuff in it (us for example), but there are places in the universe that are pretty close to being totally devoid of any matter.\nAll the material in the universe is attacted to all the other meterial in the universe through gravity. The matter in the universe has gravitated towards each other forming planets, stars, galaxies, ... leaving a lot of empty space. All this empty space is a vacuum, since by definaition, a vacuum is devoid of matter, empty.\n\nYou can ignore the fact that a true, total vacuum does not exist, not even is space.

How long a drug stays in you system is beside the point. What matter most is what kind of lab test will be performed to determine.\n\nTHE DRUG ITSELF can stay in your bloodstream up to 72 hours. However, most labs look for the metabolite, which is something that the body produces when it ingests something, in the case of cocaine it is "benzoylecgonine" that will stay around long after the drug is gone, up to 30 days for a frequent user.\n\nIf the lab prefer to take hair as a sample, cocaine can stay in your hair up to about 90 days. Nevertheless, new information is becomming apparent suggesting cocaine stay's in your hair about 25 years - even after you have only taken it once.\n\nAnd if you boyfriend has smoked weed, he definately don't have a chance. A minimum of thirty (30) days, minimum!\n\nAs medical science and employers become more and more aware of the problem exsisting in drug testing, they are choosing more complex, sophisicated testing methods. With these techniques and equipment, the only sure way to pass a test is to not do drugs and stay clear away from them.\n\nHope this answers your question!

Sometimes people want to answer more questions, so they wanna type faster, and they use abbreviations to answer questions faster. Take me, for example, usually I abbreviate things, but this past year I won the Spelling UIL contest. People just want to make things go quicker by abbreviating. And about you being the only one not to understand them, sometimes it's just because most people that use/understand abbreviations are people that use the computer more or people that instant message. Pretty soon, you'll start to understand abbreviations as well. No big, don't worry about it.

French composer, Marimba player, Career Designing Professor \n\nIn parallel to his career as a professional musician (see awards and activities), Francois Du Bois has a long experience in the field of education, that he has started at the conservatory since he was 17. He has already published 3 books regarding the learning of the marimba, his specialty. \n\nHe arrived to Japan in 1998, and was invited by Keio University SFC campus, in the Faculty of Political Science. \n\nIn 2002, he creates a course of career management (for course details see here) at the International Center of Keio University, inviting Mr. Carlos Ghosn, President of Nissan, Mr. Daryl E. Green, President of Vodafone, Ms. Yukako Uchinaga, VP of IBM Japan and others, where the guests explain their personal career management to give hints to the young generations. \n\nFrançois currently offers a workshop of career designing at the Academy Hills, inside the highest tower in Tokyo, Roppongi Hills. This highly successful workshop is offered for the working generations. \n\nThe success of this workshop is probably due to the nature of the organizer, who is a musician and a professor at the same time, a very unique personality. \n\nBesides that, François has played in the Oscar winning movies, Lost in Translation by Sofia Coppola as actor. \n\nAs a specialist of Asian music, he has been responsible of the series “Asia” inside the magazine Yomiuri Weekly (200,000 copies) for 2years, introducing varieties of music, musicians, instruments, or events, giving opinions through his original point of view. He keeps contributing to the magazine with news articles. \nHe is the member of the People of Society of Literature of France.

Right and Left are convenient shorthand for ideological tendencies. \n\nIn different countries, the actual policy positions of that country's Right and Left wings will vary. But in general, the Left is more progressive (what critics call "liberal") and the Right is more conservative (what critics call "reactionary"). What does that mean? Progessives generally favor social policies that promote social equality (more even distribution of wealth & power among citizens), broader social freedoms but more limited economic freedoms (in the US, for the rights of minorities and women, but against "corporate power"), and foreign policy based on diplomacy. Conservatives generally favor social policies that promote social inequality (greater disparities between wealthy and poor), more limited social freedoms but broader economic freedoms (in the US, against same-sex marriage & women's reproductive rights, but for strong property rights for those with property), and foreign policy based on military supremacy. In most countries, the Left is closely tied to the labor unions, to minority advocacy groups, to the women's movements, and to students; the Right is closely tied to majority religious organizations, to the dominant racial group, and to big business. \n\nLeft and Right are relative terms, and they change over time. In the 1990s, US President Bill Clinton was criticized as an ultra-leftist for attempting to create single-payer health coverage for all Americans. Yet just two decades before, ultra-Rightist US President Richard M. Nixon had suggested the exact same policy reforms. The USA had moved so significantly to the Right as a country in those two decades that what had been politically viable for a right-wing Republican was now too leftist for a centrist Democrat. \n\nIn the USA, the Right today is dominated by the dual interests of social conservatives (Christian extremist groups) and fiscal conservatives (Big Business). The Left is not dominated by any one group, but is a loose and often ineffectual coalition of many diverse interests including feminists, environmentalists, what remains of the US labor movement, and ethnic and sexual minority action groups. In the 21st century the Left has failed utterly to take power in America, and the Right has failed utterly, having taken power, to govern effectively. \n\nHope this helps.

That was long before the Phatt Pharm clothing line was launched. (I had the name first! Dang, I should have copy-righted it or trade-marked it or whatever you do! I could be rich!) Oh, well.....\nLet's face it, we live in a sexually diverse culture. Just because many men would reject such a club I don't doubt that there is a market for your "product". The reason I would select Vegas for Phatt Chicks is that you would have a large cross-section of the adult population in a city that was created tfor the express purpose of providing an outlet for adults to "let it all hang out". Besides that -- it's Vegas, Baby.\nGood luck on your proposed venture. Feel free to send me my "cut" if you use the name I have proposed. Thanks!

If the rock in your hand has definite hand chisel marks on it and bears something of a man-made shape, then you may well have found an unfinished arrowhead.\n\nFinished arrowheads look like a small 2" or 3" spearhead carved from rock, with indentions cut along either side, close to the bottom to allow the rope tie on the arrow stick.\n\nI used to love searching for and finding arrowheads. The rarest arrowhead is one made from pure crystal; usually, it's the tribal chief's arrowhead.

My experience of Incredimail is no spyware or adware, it is compatible with outlook express in a way that it can import messages and address from outlook express, but not the other way round.\nSo if you dump outlook express for incredimail a while and want to get back to it, you'll have a hard time moving your contacts/address book and existing mail to outlook.

That is just something we do as parents or brothers and sisters. They love you though and don't really mean anything by it. What you can do is have a talk with them and tell them exactly how it makes you feel..

The Los Angeles Clippers first came into existence as the Buffalo Braves in 1970. The Braves were one of three expansion franchises to join the NBA that year (the Portland Trail Blazers and the Cleveland Cavaliers were the other two), as the league dueled with the upstart American Basketball Association for prominence. After struggling through their first few campaigns, the Braves soon found playoff success under the coaching of the legendary Dr. Jack Ramsay and high scoring Bob McAdoo. Unfortunately, drastic changes in the organization's ownership during the 1976-77 season threw the team into a tailspin, resulting in back-to-back losing seasons. \n\nFollowing a proposal by then-NBA attorney David Stern, the Braves were allowed to leave Buffalo after the 1977-78 season for San Diego. The deal was a complicated one, as Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown traded places with Boston Celtics owner Irv Levin. Levin, a California businessman, was unhappy in Boston and relished the opportunity to own a team in his home state. Levin immediately renamed the club the Clippers due to San Diego's bustling harbor and seaside locale. \n\nclip·per ( P ) Pronunciation Key (klpr)\nn. \n1) One that cuts, shears, or clips. \n2) An instrument or tool for cutting, clipping, or shearing.

Yes, it can. I have suffered from hemiplegic migraines since I was 12. I'm now 33. In January I had the worst attack ever. I had a hemiplegic migraine for 2 weeks consecutively. I ended up going to the emergency room for treatment twice during that time.

1977 at age 16(Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds was the OHA team). He wanted number 9 because it was his idol Gordie Howe's number, but a teammate(Brian Gualazzi) already had it. It was actually his coach(Murray "Muzz" MacPherson) at the time who had suggested the number 99.\n\nGretzky went on to net 70 goals, 112 assists, 182 points in 64 games that season.

Given how seriously you failed to communicate with this question, you certainly should want education. You need it.
About 10% of people all over the world are left-handed (Mcmanus, 2002). However, if you are wondering risks/odds, one area may be in familial sinistrality (how many family members you ahve that are left-handed).\n\nHandedness runs in families, and even having a grandparent (who it can be argued will have be of little imitative effect) who is left-handed increases a person’s chance of being left-handed. The effects of parental sinistrality are seen below \n\n Effects of parental sinistrality (McManus, 2002)\n\nParents’ handedness (respectively)/ Percentage of left-handed children\n\nRight & Right 9.5%\nRight & Left 19.5%\nLeft & Left 26.1%\n\n\nIt is evident that children born to at least one left-handed parent are more likely than the rest of the population to be left handed.\n\nI hope that helps! all the best!

Pro Wrestling, or what I prefer to call 'Entertainment wrestling' is a planned match where the outcome is pre-determined. However, Pro Wrestling isnt entirely 100% fake.\n\nFake is not the right work to describe it, it is called a 'work'. This mean you are working with your opponent (and referee, etc) to keep the crowed entertained. WWE's style of entertainment is really crap compared to the smaller promotions. Japan is best for Pro Wrestling in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, there are matters and scenarios which can be considered real in Pro Wrestling. Although a match is pre-determined and you are not purposely hurting each other, there are going to be occassions where punches, kicks, slams connect.\n\nAlso take for example the bumps the wrestlers take. People dont see it like this because they think the ring is 'apparently' very soft and cushy. Nothing can be further from the truth. The mats are not as comfy as you think and when getting bodyslammed and clotheslined to the ground it really does take its toll on your body.\n\nOn another note, wrestlers are not just doing 1 or 2 matches a week, they are wrestling practically EVERYDAY meaning they get no time to heal. This is why wrestlers resort to painkillers or other forms of 'enhanced performance' drugs.\n\nSure, Pro Wrestling isnt 100% real, but the case of getting hurt or injured is highly likely.... even dangerous things can happen. Steve Austin has broke his neck for example because of a piledriver by Owen Hart.\n\nFor those people that says wrestling is 'fake' is okay with me, but until you get in the ring and do 2 matches everyday for 2 weeks, you wont truely understand the beatings and the dangers that I have been through. --- THAT WAS JUST 2 WEEKS ---\n\nI use to do the Pro Wrestling stuff, and I decided to leave it because the business itself is a lying, backstabbing peice of crap! I am confident to say that the WWE isnt all as nice as it makes out, even Vince McMahon!! It is all about greedy promoters making money, and unfortunately the wrestlers that make good money for the company are the crappy ones!!!\n\nAlso, in todays Pro Wrestling, it is more about gimmicks, high flying - high risk crap. The 'art' of Pro Wrestling is nearly dead, and that is the sort I favour (look into Japan guys!!!). Today, I do the real Submission Wrestling/Cage fight training stuff and today I dont disrespect the Pro Wrestling, pre-determined stuff. Pro Wrestlers go through hell just to entertain, and although I class them crazy, I give them respect also.\n\nPro Wrestling may not be real, and the Pro Wrestlers itself may not be real.... \n\nI dont like how the Pro Wrestling system is run, but I do respect the wrestlers and what they do... and I take my hat off for what they do to their bodies!!

Think about what you really want to do and have your resume at the top indicate what you want to do. Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.
ive never heard of this type of paper, but one thing that helped my son, who by the way has an autistic disorder, i would buy him the tablets from dollar general or familydollar and take one page at a time and take black marker and run it across the top and bottom line, it seemed to help him see the lines much better. also i have to make him use a pencil grip still. it really helps him write better.

Yes, I think it is time to move on. In your mind it is over however because you were together for so long you don't want to lose him completely out of your life, you want to at least be friends and from the sounds of it your not sure you even want that anymore. You need to get involved in your own life and just keep the communication minimal and slowly it will fade away. but, you need to live and get back out there into the dating world...there is a lot to see...and it is passing you by..

I just checked out the site and it looked like the Attlee's are pretty reputable shapers, keeping surfers stoked in the UK.\n\nThe board designs look good, thrusters, fish, fun shapes and longboards.\n\nAre you thinking about buying one? Talk to the folks at your surfshop about your style of surfing and they'll help you pick a good one. \n\nIf it's a used board you are interested in, it's really more about the condition of the board. Does it have a lot of dings, or major ding repairs? That can screw up the way a board rides.\n\nBut I'd have to say that Escape boards look pretty good. If I ever surf in the UK I'll try to check one out.

Though he is initially the majestic king of Thebes, he soon becomes a dejected man, humbled by his horrible fate. As the oracle predicts, Oedipus kills his father and sleeps with his mother. When Oedipus learns what he has done, he chooses exile, leaving Creon to be king.\n\nhttp://www.freebooknotes.com/page.php?link=http://www.novelguide.com/oedipustheking/index.html&book=497\n\nOedipus King of Thebes. As a young man, he saved the city of Thebes by solving the riddle of the Sphinx and destroying the monster. He now sets about finding the murderer of the former king Laius to save Thebes from plague.\n\nhttp://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-100,pageNum-9.html\n\nThe shepherd arrives and tells Oedipus that he was a servant of Laios and that Laios gave him his child to kill because of the prophecy that his son would kill him. Since the shepherd felt sorry for the child, he did not kill him, but gave him to the other shepherd. After this, Oedipus finds out that the prophecy came true. Iocaste commits suicide, and Oedipus gouges out his eyes. Then he says bye to his children, and leaves the city. \n\nhttp://summarycentral.tripod.com/oedipusrex.htm\n\nGood luck.\n\nKevin, Liverpool, England.

It's like announcing to the world, "hey I'm desperate". Most girls are already insecure.

So if she starts giving you some lame excuse about her boyfriend, etc. then you know she is lying and is not interested in you.

As a former Preschool Teacher I would let them know of your prospective plans and assure them you'll give them ample notice when they need to find a new daycare. Also have, at the time of the notice, some suggestions of places they can check out. 2 years is a long time away, a lot could change.

I'm curious how you know this info if you weren't there. Did his friend tell you or someone else?\n\n I personally think that if he's that obvious about looking at other girls, then he doesn't have much respect for you. Reverse things for a moment. How would he react if you did the same thing? I'll bet he wouldn't like it and would be sure to say so. You should do the same ( letting him know you don't appreciate being disrespected ). If he keeps doing it, then dump him. I'm sure there is a guy out there that would be more than happy to have the opportunity to give you 100% of his attention.

Anyone can mail a letter to Santa at the North Pole (located in Canada, not Alaska by the way)\n\nVolunteers at Canada post will reply to the letter.\n\nRest assured that all mail addressed to Santa will be delivered to the North Pole. While Santa certainly gets his share of international mail, his address is completely valid and he has one of the most recognizable postal codes in the world - HO HO HO. Letters addressed to Santa will have no trouble reaching their destination, however, he has asked us to remind all of his pen-pals, no matter where they live, that it is very important to include their return address so that he can write back. \n\nThe volunteer Canada Post employees who help Santa with his mail would like to add that while Santa likes to receive the beautiful crayon drawings many children include in their letters, the envelopes should be addressed in ink, to make sure the address doesn't smudge or become unreadable. As always, Canada Post encourages all children (and adults!) to do their holiday mailings early - Santa is ready to receive his letters anytime! \n\nSanta's address is: \n\nSANTA CLAUS\nNORTH POLE HOH OHO CANADA

That will make you different.
There are programs that offer education help and child care assistance and travel assistance. The thing about welfare is that if the people who used it didn't abuse it and honestly used it to get back on their feet then it wouldn't be an issue. I was on Cash Aid and Food Stamps after I left an abusive relationship. I was a single mom of a 7 year old with one on the way and moved from VA to CA to get away from the most eveil man I have ever met. I had always said that welfare is bad and should be abolished UNTIL I needed it and was grateful that it was there. I did exactly what I was suppose to do: They make you attend classes and help you find a job. I stayed on the assistance long enough to get back on my feet then I cut the benefits off (only about a year). My case worker said that even though they have tons of rules and regulations and safe guards there are still people who abuse the system which makes it hard or impossible for the people who actually need it to get it. I don't think its fair to just say that our government is gonna cut everyone off and no assistance at all because there are people who don't use it right. My dads girlfriend is in England and on all types of welfare and every assistance you can image yet she doesn't work and just lives of my dad who is here in the states - now that is wrong!!\n\nI wonder what all the people who are totally against welfare would do if they came to a point in their lives when everything gets turned upside down and they have to do what they have to to feed their children and provide a roof over their head. Would they take the assistance they have so admittly said they hate or would let their kids starve? You just dont know until something like that happens. 3 years ago, I would never had thought I'd be in a position to need assistance but it helped me get a job (and paid for daycare until I could afford it)\n\nHere in CA, if you arent disabled and can work you have to have at least 32 hours a week of some sort of work related education/job search/work etc. I wonder how these people can abuse the system - even though I was doing everything they asked and more they were on me so very hard... wanted pay stubs and updates from my boss. All that made me work even harder to get to a point when I could just live and not worry about handing in my pay stubs to them everyt other month.\n\nTo all those people who say its time for men to step up and take care of kids and for women to stop having kids they cant afford: Nice theory but reality is some men will continue to make promises and support their family then leave (or become an abusive jerk), women will get pregnant by those guys, we will make a bad decision that put us in the most unwanted of situations regardless if welfare is around or not.
I took a miliatry language class in the Army (Russian) and one of our instructors told us, "There are more teachers in Russia, teaching English, than there are students in the US, learning Russian", not too hard to figure out, Russian isn't offered in most American High Schools. However, this is part of a larger problem.\n\nThe typical American High School (grades 9-12) offers French, German. and Spanish. Some others offer Japanese and Latin, but that's about it. Russian, Chinese, Italian, Dutch, Farsi, etc., are completely ignored.\n\nMost American High Schoolers are required to at least TAKE a foreign language course, They don't have to be proficient, but they do have to get credit, in order to graduate. By contrast, in Holland, where they speak Dutch, students are REQUIRED to learn English.\n\nAs far as how many US students go on to become language teachers, work for the government in the Diplomatic Corps, or as an interpeter for the U.N., I dont have exact figures but I would guesstimate maybe .25% (one quarter of one percent)

The paper is called "papyrus". The ancient Egyptian capital was Amarna. Jars that held embalmed organs were called "canopic jars". Osiris was the god of the dead and lord of the underworld. The chemical used to preserve the bodies was called "natron". The closest word to the meaning of "mummify" is "enbalm". The Egyptian sign of life was the "ankh", a symbol worn by gods and goddesses to show immortality.
no, it is a chemical imbalance.
Cranberry juice won't help much, they are easy to get rid of at the hospital so don't worry. I'm a nursing sister and have a broken kidney (smiles.)

I've been having treatment on my left kidney since I was 13 and I've never been hurt once.
Unfortunately I was one of those poor girls in school who was blessed with C cups at a young age. Actually when I left 6th grade I was like a 32C. Along with that a females period begins...I think it has something to do with the larger mammory glands. My daughter is the same way, and I just talked to her and told her what to expect. You have to guide her thru highschool.....because the kids now are relentless. Really have to be there for her.

The answer to this question is YES.\n\nFirst, all the growth hormones we're pumping into food combined with the multiple generations of (fairly) good prenatal and childhood nutrition, children are physically maturing faster than ever.\n\nSimultaneously, as our life expectancy gets longer and longer, those children have longer to BE children before their brains point out that time is running out and they should be adults. It's widely accepted that Juliet in Romeo and Juliet would have been around 13 years old. But in a world where the average life expectancy was 30, she was already approaching middle age. Since middle age, now, is 40-50 years of age (if you assume that middle age is the part where you're about halfway through your years), then people don't feel the pressures of impending death until their 30s or 40s. Even if they think of death, they can just deny deny deny... And many of us also have parents who helicopter and don't expect us to BE grown-up.\n\nBecause of this, children stay immature mentally and emotionally longer than ever before.\n\nThe part-timers who move in with their parents? They're slackers. And their parents are enabling that behavior. The ones who jump right in already understand that real life is NOW, it's not later, and they're doing what they have to do. Think of it this way: you're going to work your butt off, retire, and die. The only way to avoid this trap is to work hard enough when you're young to retire early enough to enjoy some of life. So the ones who jump right in have the right idea.

Since the sun is a variable star, its solar output varies slightly over short time periods. Solar disturbances such as flares, prominences, and sunspots increase the amount of radiation from the sun. However, no long-term variations in the intensity of solar radiation have been measured at altitudes above Earth’s atmosphere. Solar radiation, at about 1,400 W/m2, varies by no more than 2%. In contrast, the geothermal heat flow from Earth averages only about 0.061 W/m2. Some theories have related climatic changes to sunspot cycles (11 years) and magnetic cycles (22 years), but no clear connection has yet been established between climate and sunspots or magnetic cycles. \n\nThe sun emits energy as electromagnetic radiation. Unlike sound, such radiation requires no medium, therefore this energy is able to travel through the near vacuum of space from the sun to the earth. \n\nMost radiant energy from the sun is concentrated in the visible and near-visible parts of the EM spectrum, and it peaks at about 500 nm, very near the 555 nm visibility peak for Homo sapiens, a result which surely is not a coincidence (and is connected to evolution). Less than 1% of solar radiation is emitted as X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves. \n\nOnly about 25%, or about 350 W/m2, of incoming solar radiation penetrates the transparent atmosphere of the earth. The remainder is either absorbed by the atmosphere or scattered back into space. There are some latitudinal differences found on Earth. These variations are determined by time of year, by the wavelength of the energy being transmitted, and by the depth and nature of the intervening material. \n\nTerrestrial radiation is produced mainly as a result of reradiation of solar radiation. The energy is absorbed from the sun as the sun’s spectrum but reradiated from Earth at the much longer wavelengths associated with the temperature of Earth. The Wien displacement law, in which the wavelength is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, provides a comparison of those peak wavelengths. \n\nSince the sun has a surface temperature 20 times greater than that of Earth, the reradiated energy has a spectrum that peaks at a wavelength 20 times longer than the 500 nm for the sun, or at about 10,000 nm, well into the infrared. Since the atmosphere is more absorptive to such long-wavelength terrestrial radiation, the atmosphere is heated from the ground up instead of vice versa. \n\nIn addition, water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb the long wavelengths of radiation from the earth especially well, leading to the so-called "greenhouse" effect. (The temperature in real greenhouses rises mainly because the glass prevents the heated air from rising, thereby increasing the temperature inside.) Ozone, on the other hand, absorbs only very short wavelengths, mainly in the ultraviolet range, and therefore forms a shield of sorts, absorbing much of the ultraviolet radiation before it can reach the earth. \n\nRadiation from the sun follows an inverse square law, so that comparisons of the solar constant can be made for other planets if we know their mean distances from the sun in AU. For example, Mars is 1.93 times further from the sun than is Earth. Its solar constant should therefore be about 27% that of Earth, about 374 W/m2. Because there is little atmosphere to absorb the energy, this is about the same as what we receive at the surface of Earth. \n\nSpacecraft have provided us with temperature measurements for both Mars and Venus. Mars has an average temperature of about 5 oC, whereas Venus has a temperature of about 500 oC. Earth is about 1.4 times further away from the sun than is Venus, and we would expect from the inverse square law that it would receive about twice as much radiation. The fact that its temperature is so much greater can be attributed only to greenhouse warming. \n\nWinter and summer seasons on Earth are a consequence not just of the obliquity factor associated with the sun’s r

I don't fondly remember ALL the people involved in my past. Some of the kids I grew up with were downright mean and nasty to me. Still, having to deal with them taught me valuable life lessons.

Yes, with practice it is possible to visualize four dimensional objects. At first it is better to use analogy with lower dimensions. For example, a sphere in three dimensions consists of parallel stacks as follows: a point for the south pole; circles growing until the equator, then shrinking again until you have a point at the north pole. In exactly the same way, a sphere in four dimensions is a stacked collection of three dimensional *spheres*: a point at the north and south poles, spheres growing larger as you move north until the equator (the largest sphere), then shrinking again as you approach the north pole.\n\nAt first, we see the spheres as one sphere expanding and contracting, but if you practice a lot, you can begin to see the whole four dimensional sphere. Similar analogies can be done for 'cubes' in four dimensions and other figures. As others have pointed out, it is possible to use time to help the visualizations. But don't take the 'time is the fourth dimension' stuff too seriously in math. The physics time dimension has properties very different than another space dimension.

No way, I would be way too hurt. Plus if they do that then they don't really appreciate you. So why should you stay with them. I might forgive them if they cheated once when they were drunk or something, and I could tell that it was absolutely something that they regret and I am the only one they want. However, making a separate whole new side life from you, that is just saying that you are not enough for them for one. And damn it....why would anybody forgive anybody who would do that s***. They don't even deserve a new girlfreind or wife ever again in their entire lives!!! If that happened to be I would tell any new person that he attempted to date what happened, so they would leave him!! He doesn't deserve s***!!

First of all, I would get a NEW family doctor. What you have, is probably Pleurisy. Here are the symptoms: it hurts to breath deeply or cough. You may also have severe,but one-sided,chest pain.The symptoms are accompanied by others that are associated with the underlying disorder. The pain will disappear if pleural effusion occurs as a result of pleurisy, because fluid will prevent the roughened or inflamed layers of the pleura from rubbing against each other. If this happens, you may become BREATHLESS! You need to see a doctor, have your lungs "sounded' and a "chest x-ray" the x-ray will determine what caused this. If you are not allergic to Aspirin, this is the recommendation. Aspirin will ease your pain. Go NOW and get your lungs tested. Better to be safe then sorry.

Eat less move more. I eat once a day and when I take my daughter to the park or whatever I get up and play with her instead of sitting on the bench like all the other mothers. The whole 2000 cal a day is too much for anyone, you can actually gain weight on 2000 cal a day. To lose weight you want to eat more like 1200 cal a day and 1800 to maintain. Make sure you eat a healthy 1200 cals. Don't eat empty calories.
I am a Real Estate Broker in Oregon and there is NO reason why the buyer should ever see what you owe on the home. However a tax search can be pulled by anyone and that will tell the person doing the search what the amount of the last loan was and when(unless something has changed recently because tax searches on the internet are usually upto 6 months behind). Any agent or broker has the access to see what the taxes are on any property in the state which they are licensed in. Good Luck!!

I don't know how old you are, but try to hangout with the guy: maybe work on homework together or invite him and his friends to hang out with you and your friends. Pay attention to him but be cool about it-NO tripping, getting over-excited or stalking or acting obsessed. If he gets the clue and tells you he likes you-mission accomplished! If he seems interested but you get the feeling he is too shy to admit he likes you then just casually ask him to hangout, just the two of you this time. If he doesn't seem interested play it cool and let it slide, you don't want to lose a friend and besides there are plenty of guys out there who would like a thoughtful girl like you. Good luck!!!

Time doesn't erase the past.\n\nAn estimated $850 million in U.S. assets were seized by the Castro in 1960.\n\nThe guy spent his whole life comparing capitalism to imperialism, and at the same time killing thousands of political opponents over that same span.\n\nHe was on the wrong side of the Cold War.\n\nHe had many opportunities to forge a partnership (or mend it depending on your perspective) with the U.S. before the embargo of 1962.\n\n\nBottom line is that a lot has to happen for us to just forget the past and let bigons be bigons.

Weight loss surgery-like gastric bypass /lap band surgery / stomach stapling and gastrectomy have become very common and very safe now. My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.
The larger crystals in granite tell us that it formed deep underground. Geologists call such rocks intrusive igneous rocks. Insulated from the coolness of earth's surface, the molten rock (magma--molten rock underground) cooled slowly and the crystals had time to grow large. Basalt flowed onto earth's surface as molten rock (lava--molten rock on earth's surface) and there it cooled quickly, so the crystals had little time to grow. Geologists call such rocks extrusive igneous rocks.\n\nThere are other differences between granites and basalts, but I think speed of cooling, related to where the molten rock cooled, answers your question.

Semi-permanant color lasts up to 6 weeks. That just means that it will fade off a little bit. You cannot control how much your hair grows. It grows a 1/2 inch every monthy on average. Therefor, you will always need to color it every 4 to 6 weeks. To keep your hair healthier, I would suggest that you see a professional because it is relaxing and easier, plus everyone can tell if you color your own hair. Trust me. If you keep doing it at home, then do a retouch when needed and on the 2nd time that you would retouch the roots, pull the color to the rest of your hair the last 5 minutes to refresh it. You can use whatever you prefer too-semi or permanant. I would use permanant to prevent fading. And don't forget a color safe shampoo! Hope this helps!

This is best understood in terms of them both being on the borderline between metals and non-metals - in particular, the fact that their oxides are acidic.\nBoron is quite different to silicon in respect of the fact that its simple covalent compounds are electron-deficient, that is they only have six electrons in the outer level. Thus they are strong Lewis acids.\nSilicon can accept electron pairs, but only by expanding its valency octet.
you could always invite her out as a group, like ask her to bring a friend and you bring a friend, and you all go to the movies. Let her learn some things about you and then ask her out on a date for just the two of you.

The method you mentioned is useful if it is osteo-arthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. It is more of a preventative than a treatment. The vinegar balances the bodies pH, and the molasses provides iron. And remember that all ingredients must be organic. Another good preventative/restorant is "organic egg". Place an organic egg or three in a wide-mouth jar and cover with organic freshly squeezed lemon juice. Let it sit for about a week, gently shaking daily. The vinegar leaches the calcium from the egg. Gently remove the egg itself (it will still have the membrane on it), and keep the calcium rich liquid. It will be calcium citrate, the most absorb-able form of calcium. Take three tablespoons a day.
Hon, I am extremely proud of you. You deserve to be treated with at least respect, and you were not even given that. You find someone who is worthy of you!

Bunch of people took it in high school football I knew. I was in soccer so I didnt need it but I know it makes your muscles just look bigger by making the protien absorb more water. It's been shown in studies if you take it your more likely to get hurt in physical activities. The long term effects of the product are still unknown. Take at your own risk.

my opinion is that someone that drinks & drives & takes a life deserves the death penalty. Sorry to sound so harsh but my bro in law's cousin got hit by a drunk driver while she was driveing her taxi. She gave birth 2 months early & the baby died 2 weeks later & the guy killed the passenger in her car. So two lives i have no pitty for drunk drivers i dont care how damn good of a person you are. They can rott in hell.
My little brother learned by starting with training wheels, but here's what we did a little differently. As soon as he started showing some confidence, we bent the arms of the training wheels so that the bike could lean a little farther over before the wheels made contact with the ground. Then, when we was confident with that, we removed one of the training wheels altogether, until in the end, he really didn't need them anymore. It was a progressive way to give him less and less support but still the illusion of a safety net.\n\nHope this helps.

My friend and I have this conversation often. Sometimes you get the feeling like "Is this all there is?" THere are days I am completely content and so thankful for all I have...a loving, caring husband, a beautiful 9 month old son that I adore, a wonderful family, and a job that I...well, Love is a strong word...LIKE! \nBut, then there are days I wonder what if???\nI think it is human nature to always wonder what else is out there. And if you had made different choices where would life have led you? Very deep huh? :)

Start out lifting small weight, as curls and also doing push ups. My son began with 2 push ups a few months ago. BUT he was consistent. NOW he does many and is much stronger! I used to throw to him and I am his mom! I cannot do as well, but I keep lifting weights gradually and doing arm exercises....\nAlso, keep practicing throwing, as well as lifting either your body weight or weights....\nI hope this is helpful.
Yes, especially if you are concentrated in it, you might as well be considered smoking it. It is best to stay clear of these situations. If this is just a one time deal, and was not for a long period of time, you may be in the clear. Always give your body a good flushing, drink plenty of water, cranberry juice, and eat lots of vegetables.

Ask questions that are intersting and that are bound that generate engaging conversation. Questions like, "Who's your favorite band?" and junk like that aren't going to keep people's interest. Look at blog sites and see what people are intersted in right now and ask questions based on current topics.

Most every prepubescent and blossoming darling fancies a teacher at some point...just know that it is fantasy. If the teacher has his ducks in a row, he will know how to deflect her. My favorite teacher from prep school later told me as an adult, that "I wasn't easy to teach..." Just watch your vibes and how you send it out...because a bad teacher just may take you up on it, and then you'll be out of your league, babe. And he'll be out of a job.
Most of the world's rainforest has already been destroyed. After it is destroyed, it can never be re-created. Therefore, any damage to the rainforest should be prohibited and punished most severely. The eco-systems and the species of the rainforest generally cannot survive elsewhere. It is the responsibility of humans to protect the forms of life which have been so egregiously damaged by human action. Not one centimeter of rainforest should be subject to harm.

The best way to cure a cold is to not get one in the first place. Believe it or not its not normal to catch a cold. I may get a cold every 4 years or so, and generally only catch one under stressful conditions, when I mess with my sleep and don't eat right. \n\nIf you have a cold its your body's way of saying my immune system is weakened. \n\nTO AVOID CATCHING COLDS EVER:\n\n1)Make sure you control stress in your life, \n2) that you are eating properly (Is your vegetarian diet created by a nutritionist so that you don't get ill because you lack proper nutrients? or did you just create it yourself by deciding not to eat meat? Be healthy and make sure your diet is meeting your own bodys requirements) \n3)get proper rest for your body(generally between 7-10hrs a night sleep), \n4) Maintain routine schedules (eating, sleeping, exercise, etc). \n5) Wash your hands regularly and throughly throughout the day. \n6) During high cold seasons when several people around you are sick, use a plain SALINE NASAL spray throughout the day. \n7) Take a well balanced multi-vitamin daily. High doses of Vit c (500mg) are good for you. \n8) Exercise regulary. \n\nOnce you have a cold the best way to treat it is to treat the symptoms with medicine (Tylenol Cold), get plenty of rest (16hrs), drink lots of water and liquids, eat several small light meals (avoid carrots and other vegetables that are hard to digest. You don't want you body spending the energy to digest hard foods when you are ill. Soups, oatmeal,veg broths,oranges, are good to include) And give it a few days to past. Your body will heal itself if it is healthy enough.

ok...well here is a detailed explaination\n\nfirst you need to conver 8 1/4 to an improper fraction,\nin general this means:\na b/c = (a*c +b)/c\n\nin your case \n8 1/4 = (8*4 +1)/4 = (32+1)/4 = 33/4\n\nthen you need to do the same for the second fraction\n5 1/2 = (5*2 +1)/2 = (10+1)/2 = 11/2\n\nnow you have the following\n33/4 -11/2\n\nwell to add this you need to have common denominators (bottoms of the fractions), to do this you need to find the smallest number that both 4 and 2 go into...in this case both of these numbers go into 4...(4*1=4 and 2*2=4)\n\nnow you need to get that second fraction to have a denominator of 4...to do this you notice that 2*2 is 4 so we need to multiply that second fraction by 2/2 (so the top and bottom of the fraction is multiplied by 2. you would wonder why the top and bottom...the reason is because 2/2 =1 and we can multiply a number by 1 and it doesnt chage its value...we are just making 1 look funny so we can get the same denomintors\n\nnow ...\n\n11/2 * 2/2 = (11*2)/ (2*2) = 22/4 ( we recall we multiply the two top numbers and the two bottom numbers respectively)\n\nnow do your subtraction now that we have common denomintaors\n\n33/4-22/4 = (33-22)/4 (here we only subtract the numerator (top))\n\nso 11/4 is our answer\n\ni hope this helps....\nmatttlocke
If the loan was a Deed of Trust, it is stunningly rare for there to be a deficiency judgement. It is only likely if there is fraud involved or if the lien holder thinks that you have a lot of other money hidden away. Instead of the simple 120 day foreclosure, he has to go to a judge and file suit based on the note. It doesn't happen unless the lender thinks it will be really worth their time. \n\nLeigh M\nPortland\nhttp://www.LeighMaynard.com\nI am a realtor in Oregon and Washington\n\nPS -- If you are behind on your loan and may lose the house, please email me off list. I know someone who may be able to stop the foreclosure and help save your credit. You can email me from my website. Best wishes!

It´s a good idea to invest but you need a plan. \n\nInstead of investing assets in a lump sum, you can work your way into an investment position by slowly buying small amounts each month. This spreads the cost basis out over several years, providing insulation against up and down periods of the stock market. \n\nThis method is called Dollar Cost Averaging.\n\nIn order to begin a dollar cost averaging plan, you must do three things:\n1. Decide exactly how much money you can invest each month. Make certain that you are financially capable of keeping the amount consistent; otherwise the plan will not be as effective.\n 2. Select an investment (index funds are particularly appropriate) that you want to hold for the long term, preferably five to ten years or longer.\n 3. At regular intervals (monthly or quarterly works best), invest that money into the funds you’ve chosen. If your broker offers it, set up an automatic withdrawal plan so the process becomes automated. \n\nThis idea works even better in a tax deferred savings plan like a 401K in the USA.\n\nThe source refers to Dollar Cost averaging, but the whole site is interesting.

give it time. eventually you two will become more comfortable around each other. as you become more familiar with each other, your encounters will become less awkward. just be patient with yourself and with her, and if your really love one another it will work itself out. try spending time in less public places if that makes you uncomfortable. try to find the setting that both of your are comfortable in and then just let things happen at a relaxed pace. ya'll will be fine. don't give up. seems you already have one important thing in common. good luck!

I will believe that Islam is not a violent terrorist religion when the following happen:\n\n* Muslims can find their way to believe other religions without being condemned to death.\n* Crowds of gun-toting men do not celebrate terrorist acts against America, Israel, Europe, or India.\n* Muslim nations agree to Israel's right to exist peacefully without the threat of annihilation from its neighbors.\n* Palestinians are respected as people and given state assistance rather than being condemned to refugee camps by the same Arab nations who claim to support them.\n* Westerners are no longer kidnapped and beheaded.\n* Young men and women no longer wrap themselves in explosives in the delusional belief that suicide and murder will be rewarded in the afterlife.\n* Women are allowed divorce rights without losing their children.\n* Women are allowed to drive and to pursue careers.\n* Women are considered people and not chattel to their husbands.\n* Muslims are allowed, and even encouraged, to think for themselves and embrace individualism.\n\nUntil then, it doesn't matter what the Koran may say in theory. Actions matter. And actions in the US, the UK, Spain, Indonesia, Turkey, Tanzania, Kenya, Israel, Egypt, France, and India make it clear that Islam is a culture of violence and murder. If this is not true, it's incumbent on every Muslim in the world to stand up and fight those who besmirch their name.

It just depends... in the past, all that was needed was bi-lingualism, and a bit of luck to be in the right place at the right time. In the modern day, some regulation is being brought to the art... I think Bath runs an MA in translation that's supposed to be really good, I've just finished Newcastle university's MA in translation studies... there are professional associations as well, from memory I think the ILT is the British one, the Institute of Linguists and Translators- I think they have their own tests. To do free-lance work, you don't need any of this- http://www.translatorsbase.com is one example of a website which you pay a registration fee for, and then you can bid on projects that conform to your speciality. \n\nI think free-lance can be a bit rough though- from what I've read, to make a living from it, you need to be working in a disciplined manner throughout the week, translating thousands of words a day, and your income is based upon how much you can put out- maybe you're talented enough for that, I don't know... I mean, talent and language ability is a big part of translation, but you can learn a lot about theory as well, either on a course, or through your own research. I'm aiming for an in-house post, I mean, in some company where senior staff will be able to offer guidance and advice, and I think the MA's going to be a boon in that...\n\nI think there are quite a few options available in post-graduate courses, and possibly shorter courses offered by other institutions as well. I'd encourage you to think about it. For one thing, you can learn tips about the trade that you may not think of if you start freelance straight off, and have your work looked at by people with experience at the kind of jobs you're aiming for on a weekly basis. Secondly, it raises the bar. Compared to other professions, there is a feeling that translation and interpreting is not fully fledged as yet, and income is relatively lower. Of course, I'm a bit biased having just come off the course, but I think it's helped a lot. Being in groups with other translation students is pretty helpful, you can learn from other people's style, everyone benefits.

It is also called Water Cycle.It is the cyclic movement of water on and around our planet Earth.\n 1. Oceans are very large bodies of water.Every day plenty of this is evoperated due to Sun's heat and converted in to clouds.\n 2.Depending upon the seasons and the locations this water vapour is reconverted in to rain drops, snow flakes and returned to the earth.\n3.On the earth is received by rivers and it flows back to the oceans.\n4.A large quantity of the sweet water ic permanently locked in the polar regions and on the mountains.\n This is in short Hydrological cycle.Human life is greatly dependent onit.

For a monthly payment of $550, paying off in 10 years, you can only borrow around $50,000 (at 6.125%). So that covers your debts and repairs, but not much else. \n\nUnfortunately, depending how much you owe on your house, you probably wouldn't get a rate of 6.125%. Second mortages tend to run 8-9% or higher depending on your credit rating. This would cap your borrowing at around $45,000 to keep that $550 payment.

Clean up the corrupt Mexican government 100% and stop lining their own pockets with aide money that is meant for their citizens. Build up their own economy so their citizens can have a decent life in their own country. Beef up their education system so their people can compete with the rest of the world. Maybe then the citizens of Mexico would not feel a need or desire to head to the USA for that better life.\n\nPancha, Mexico has elections for their government so I would say that makes the country a democracy.

Hi, Did you get her license plate number off of her vehicle? If so, you should be able to track down the vehicle through the department of motor vehicles, if your state allows it. If you have no luck there, it sounds like you have a situation where you may need to file a small claim suit against her which should cost you around $100 and you can ask the judge for reimbursement for this amount (providing you can at least get her mailing address to file with). If not, sounds like you are stuck with paying for your own repair. It might be a good idea to shop around and get more than one estimate for repair...good luck

No it does not work they are all SHAMS !!!!!!!! HERE ARE SOME REAL TIPS.If you follow these tips you will lose weight.\nFirst of all your body can healthly lose only 2-4 lbs a week. Also i would not reccomend one of those diet books or programs because once you lose the weight you will go back to doing what you did before and gain it all back.\nHere is what you need to cut out of your diet or limit.\n-sodas they are empty calories and just add fat.\n-also juices try to limit 1 cup of o.j. has as much sugar as a can of soda.\n-fast food. they provide no nutrients and terrible meals they do have healthly selections at all fast food stores if you pic those you will do much better. \n-junk food is also empty calories its ok now and then just don't over do it.\nHere are foods that you can indulge on.\n-veggies since they are so healthy for you and provide you with many nutrients the calories in them are meaningless.\n-water!! you should drink64oz. a day at first you will pee alot but then you will get used to it.\n-when eating meat try to eat chicken because it is the best.\nother tips\n- try to have baked foods not fried.\n-eat breakfast and try to have it mostly be complex carbs like oatmeal and wheat bread they will give you energy all throughout the day.\n-don't skip meals when you do your body thinks it is being starved so it will hold in more calories instead of burning them.\nWORKING OUT\nyou need to buy some weights or go to a gym and work on increasing your muscles. because that will increase you resting metabolic rate which is how many calories you burn while simply doing nothing and you will see weight loss just from that also doing 50-100 squats(5-10min) will help increase muscle in your legs.\nrunning is also a good way to help your overall apperience.\nand pilates is a good way to tone your body a simple pilates tape done three times a week along with weights and you will see a difference.\n\ngo online and find some healthy meal recipes and use them try to reduce the number of calories you take in daily but not by too much.\nhope this helps you.

Weight training will not stunt your growth unless you damage your growth (Epiphyseal Cartilage) plates. This is rare and will not happen if you follow a sound exercise program. To be safe, avoid one rep maximum lifts for now and check your ego out at the door; follow sound progressive weight training practices
why can't you apply for both? You need to go to both departments and check out there facilities and what the people are like. Also, see what you can find out about what research is coming out of each of them. The more they're producing and getting pulished in better journals, the better. Its not just about the city, its about the quality of the research you'll be doing.

bnp is the most corrupt & racist of all...theyre not even a real party.\nthe bnp "is wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples" and is therefore committed to "restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948". To achieve this aim, the BNP advocates the use of "firm but voluntary incentives" to remove ethnic minorities from the UK. Membership of the party is restricted to "Indigenous Caucasians". A British National Party European election candidate in the Eastern region had close links in the 1980s with a convicted criminal and two notorious paedophiles. \nSid Chaney, an elderly former Londoner and Islington National Front officer who now lives in Essex, is sixth on the BNP's list for Eastern England and a council election candidate in Basildon. In the 1980s his circle of friends included Desmond Fenwick, who was involved in a number of police investigations into horrific murders of gay men, and George Wilson, who had a liking for very young boys. \nChaney was around when a gang of teenage armed robbers, who were politically involved with both the NF and the extreme nazi British Movement, were frequent visitors to Wilson's flat, which doubled as the local NF headquarters. \nPaedophilia is one of the most dreadful crimes against children. The BNP has made paedophilia a major plank of its 2004 election campaign and has tried to barge in on local campaigns on the issue. Now Searchlight reveals the BNP's own dirty secrets as a service to voters to warn them of the type of people who are campaigning for their votes. \nSearchlight published the full story of Chaney and his disgusting circle of friends and fellow fascists in Islington in September 1985 in conjunction with the Daily Mirror. Space precluded us from reproducing it in this month's Searchlight but you can read it here on our website and make up your own mind about the BNP's criminal hypocrisy. The British National Party will be fielding a total of 21 candidates in London on 10 June although some of them are doubling up. As Searchlight went to press the party had named candidates for all 11 London-wide seats in the London Assembly, a mayoral candidate who is also standing for the Assembly and a full list of nine for the London constituency in the European election. The BNP website includes photographs and short biographies of the party's candidates around the country except that, with four weeks to go until polling day, some photos and several biographies for the London candidates were still missing. This may be because many of the candidates' past activities are rather embarrassing for Nick Griffin's new "clean" BNP. The many candidates with criminal convictions and a penchant for the policies of Hitler's Third Reich reflect how poorly organised the BNP is in London. In pole position on the London European list is Chris Roberts. Not a serious choice, this former alleged City high flyer has been described as a man from some village that is missing its idiot - and this was by a fellow BNP member. He is the brother of the notorious Barry Roberts, who is number 2 on the London Assembly list. Whereas Chris lives in leafy Essex and has long abandoned London, his brother still resides in southeast London where he grew up in the company of the openly nazi and violent British Movement and the National Front. After belatedly turning to the BNP, Barry Roberts was among those who guarded a meeting addressed by the arch liar and Holocaust denier David Irving, alongside leading violent members of the nazi terror group Combat 18, such as Charlie Sargent, who is now serving a life sentence for murder. \nChris Roberts is very coy about his early politics but a rumoured early link with US extremists may account for his love of the USA and his abandoning of the
There are a couple things that you can do\n\n- look for for sell signs in the neighborhood that you're interested. you can get a sense of how much you need for the house that you like\n\n- get a pre-approval from a bank, this way you know how much a bank is willing to lend you\n\n- ask friends/relatives for referrals of real estate agents.\n\nOnce you contacted the agent, he/she will show you houses that match the critiria you mentioned. So it's better to know what you want first.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, consumer groups alleged that Dow Corning's silicone breast implants caused numerous health problems including breast cancer, auto immune diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 class action settlement in which tens of thousands of plaintiffs accepted a $3.2 billion award. Dow Corning was in bankruptcy protection for nine years that ended in June 2004.\n\nIn 1999, however, an independent review of all previous research on the issue concluded that the implants, even when ruptured, caused no major health problems beyond local hardening or scarring of the breasts. The issue remains contentious, mostly because the aforementioned review could not address the scope of claims of injury due to ruptured implants, for example, the health impact on an unborn child.
See my friend....you would have to insure the pseudo criminal with ideals, not money. Unless, you are independently wealthy and you could insure their family with monies. YOU know why it is this way? Because insurance companies are smart and they are in the business of making money, not WASTING it.\n\nGood Luck
first of all i want to say, thank you for your love of the bigger ladies, because i am one, and second off people descriminate because the media discriminates against the larger sizes. the media always portrays the skinny women as hot, successful and powerful on tv and movies, and if you notice those of a larger size are always less successful, less powerful, and made to look dorky...it sucks, but it's nice to see someone stepping up and going public with his appreciation, you're a shining light to all those larger ladies who are looking for a good guy that will love them the way they are! Kudos to you!

Call around to local insurance company's and tell them about your business, ask them for referrals. They supply insurance to homeowners and more specific, (Renters insurance.) \n\nPeople who rent often don't realize the importance of having it. all i did was take a quick video of the inside of my rented home. they can give a copy of the vid the their insurance company. \nGood Luck.

If you have another job lined un it could be a good reason to leave a job if they are or will be overloading you with work. \n\nIf you do not have another job lined up this may be an actual opportunity. It is actually a good sign that your boss is telling you his expectations(even if they seem unreasonable). Think about things that could make your job easier and/or better. Now is a great time to ask for them. For example you might tell your boss, because the workload will increase, if I can work from home for a couple of days a week I will be better able to avoid the office distractions and be more productive.
How To Remove Skunk Smell\nSkunks spray a strong smelling fluid from a gland under their tail. It is a defense mechanism to repel would-be attackers. It adheres where sprayed and can last for many days. The spray is not easily washed away and instead must be neutralized.\n\nWashing or bathing in tomato juice to remove skunk smell is a popular myth. It does have a small neutralizing effect, but is really more likely to leave one smelling of skunk AND tomato juice. \n\nThe following recipe is effective at neutralizing skunk odor and can be used on people, pets, tires or any object that has been sprayed by a skunk. Note however, that it contains hydrogen peroxide and can cause skin, eye and mucous membrane irritation. Peroxide can also cause fading or damage to clothing, carpet, paint and so on. If you are concerned about the possibility of damage, test it on an inconspicuous portion of the material. Thorough rinsing with water will help to minimize any fading or damage. \n\nMix together:\n\nOne quart 3% hydrogen peroxide* \n\n¼ cup baking soda\n\none teaspoon liquid dish soap\n\n* white vinegar can be substituted, but it is not as effective\n\nIf washing a pet, keep the solution out of their ears and avoid their eyes and mouth. Wash thoroughly with the solution then rinse thoroughly. Repeat if necessary. Use the solution immediately after preparation. Do not store unused solution. \n\nRemoving skunk spray is most effective during the first few hours after spraying.

Treatment Options\n \nRosacea \nHow is it treated?\n\n\nWhile rosacea currently has no cure, various treatments are available that can help control it. Treatment may also keep it from progressing. Since the symptoms of rosacea usually vary not only from individual to individual, but also from time to time for any one patient, the choice of treatment will depend on the subtype and severity of rosacea, as well as on the patient’s emotional and physical impairment. Some rosacea treatment options include topical antibiotics, other topical preparations, oral antibiotics, laser therapy, and plastic surgery. \n\nThe main goals of rosacea treatment are to control the flare-up, prevent or decrease progression, and improve the appearance of the skin. Unfortunately, several weeks or months of treatment may be needed before improvement is apparent. In fact, topical treatments may even worsen facial redness at first. Most often, laser therapy is used to eliminate tiny widened blood vessels under the skin, and surgery removes thickened skin (most commonly from the nose). Laser and surgical treatments usually result in bruising and/or swelling that may take several days to disappear. \n\nDrug Treatment \n\nGenerally, a rosacea flare-up is treated with a combination of prescription drugs. A topical product (an antibiotic and/or another type of drug) may be applied to the affected areas and oral antibiotics may be taken, as well. Both topical and oral medications are used to reduce inflammation and/or control micro-organisms that may be involved with the flare-up. Once the flare-up is under control, oral antibiotics usually are discontinued. Topical products are often used continuously, however, to help maintain remission and prevent recurrence. \n\nTopical Preparations \n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three topical products — metronidazole, azaleic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur — for treating rosacea. Topical preparations, which may come in a variety of forms that include creams, gels, ointments, and solutions, are applied directly to affected areas of the face. While topical antibiotics are widely used to treat rosacea, their effectiveness may be due more to anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties than to antibiotic activity. A cream or gel form of metronidazole is the topical antibiotic most often used for rosacea. Other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat the condition include clindamycin and erythromycin. \n\nTopical tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative that is not an antibiotic, sometimes is used to reduce rosacea papules and pustules. Benzoyl peroxide, commonly used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to treat teen acne, may also treat rosacea eruptions. Not only antibacterial, benzoyl peroxide also promotes exfoliation (also called desquamation) — it causes dead skin cells to fall off. It may cause stinging and worsen redness for some patients, however. In fact, most topical medications cause dryness, which may make skin look and feel more irritated — especially when therapy is begun. Gently applying small amounts of the topical preparation only twice a day, avoiding sunlight, and applying a water-based moisturizer can help reduce irritation. \n\nOral Antibiotics \n\nShort treatments (a few days or weeks) of an oral antibiotic, such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, minocycline, or tetracycline, may be given to control a flare-up. Frequently, these drugs are also used to treat teen acne. Due to possible side effects, longer-term oral antibiotics usually are reserved for rosacea patients with more severe forms of the condition or for those with eye-related symptoms. Typically, oral antibiotics are more effective than topical antibiotics in clearing papules and pustules. \n\nOccasionally other types of oral drugs may be used to treat rosacea. For example, isotretinoin, which is used mainly for teen acne, may help clear rosacea papules an

The Cape Verde islands experienced the longest period of European colonization of any African nation. The Portuguese remained in direct control of this island archipelago from 1460 to 1975. In their struggle for independence from Portugal, beginning in the 1950s, the people of Cape Verde linked their fortunes to that of Guinea Bissau on the West African mainland under a unified movement, the PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde), formed in 1956.The armed struggle against the Portuguese lasted from 1963 until 1974 when a negotiated peace settlement was arranged. While achieving independence for themselves, the Portuguese African resistance movements, including those of Angola and Mozambique, had succeeded in bringing down the fascist Portuguese government in Lisbon. Elections were held in June 1975, and the Republic of Cape Verde was declared formally independent from Portugal on 5 July.\n\nAlso check out http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-129476/Cape-Verde\n\nHope some of this helps =)

I used to have one. I think he was just lonely. He spent his life with his wife and after she passed he looked for companionship. I didn't take advantage of him. I remained his friend and in return he extended his kindness as well. He took care of the things I would allow him to. I believe that was the thrill for him.... just knowing that he could be needed again at times.
I believe there is a chance that we will eventually, however I would not say that it would make us win the world cup, cause teams create great players all the time and doens't mean they are gonna win the World Cup, look at Spain and England, and even Argentina hasn't won in awhile. To win it takes a good mix of luck and talent. Right now the closest thing we have to a possible Pele, or Maradona is Freddy Adu, and while I think he is a great player, I don't believe he will be as good as them, but he is developing nicely, he is only 15 or 16 I am not sure.
my brother was watching it and he said something about Nate being gone.
Rodney Carney maybe. He's super athletic and has good shooting skills
First, don't listen to these smart-ass people bein' rude to you. Second, i would recommend that you go to a health clinic and tell them that you haven't had your period in a few months and they will give u a pill that will make u ovualate. I believe u take it for 10 days so wait about the 6 day to have sex, and if that doesn't work then have yourself checked out to see if you can get pregnant. hope all goes well.....

There are some technical problems that God would have faced in including dinosaurs in the creation account. There is no word for "dinosaur" in the Hebrew language. Now, God could have invented a Hebrew word for dinosaur and explained what those animals were like and how they had died out. However, this is a one page description of the creation of the world and life in it. Trying to explain about an extinct group of creatures would have taken a lot of space and distracted from the rest of the creation account.\n\nObviously, there were a lot more creatures than just dinosaurs that were left out of the creation account. If God were to have included every creature in the creation account (well over one billion), such inclusion would have completely lost the spiritual significance of the passage (and would be much longer than the Bible itself). The purpose of the Genesis creation account is to give an account of how God created mankind and provided for him. The account, like the entire Bible, centers on God and His miraculous workings for mankind. Therefore, in the creation account, we find the supernatural creation of the universe by God, indicating that the universe wasn't always here, but created by God for man. Next, it talks about the creation of plants, which are important to humans, since we eat them, and also important to the animals that we rely upon, which also eat them. Then, it talks about the sea creatures and birds, which we also eat. It next talks about the beasts of the field, which we eat and use for labor. Then it talks about the creation of mankind and how he is to have dominion and manage the earth and its creatures.\n\nThe second chapter of Genesis gives a spiritual account of the creation of mankind and man's relationship to God. The entire account is centered on God and man. Therefore, one would expect the creation account to describe events that are important to mankind.\n\n And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n\n And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\nThe fact is that dinosaurs are as unimportant to us as they were to the Hebrews to whom the creation account was given. The purpose of the creation account is to provide an explanation of how God provided for mankind and created him as the one spiritual animal on earth. The account is purposely brief and centered upon mankind - the only creature God created on earth to enter into a personal relationship with Him. The Genesis creation account contains all the information necessary to fulfill the purpose given for the recording of the pages of the Bible. As an exercise to illustrate the point, you might want to write your own one page creation account. In doing this, you should center the account on mankind and the creation miracles God used to prepare the earth for him. What you will find is that there is not room to discuss dinosaurs or any other extinct species of life.

Don't cut it off... Like the other 2 guys before me said you might try stretching it... I am uncircumcised and I have stretched it a little bit yeah it hurts a little so I would suggest try inserting 2 fingers if you can try slowly spreading you fingers... I know of this one guy no kidding... fit eight fingers in there he told me he started with 4 fingers. But if stretching doesn't work for you you might want to get circumcised (sex should be enjoyable).

The short answer is that yes, it could be a sign of depression, but only if combined with several other factors. I would advise you to go to the doctor and get checked out for physical problems - then if none are found, you should probably go to a psychiatrist for a consultation. In addition, a full battery of psychological testing would be a good idea, if possible. Check out the link below for the signs of depression - you have to have 4 or 5 most of the time, for at least 2 weeks, without a situational cause.

She loves you. And because she loves you she feels more free to do things with you. Maybe it's you. Hygine down below? Is it a jungle down there? Try trimming above the tree line and shaving below, ya follow? Showering an hour before sex is good also. Because a little walking and a flight of stairs or so is all it take for Big Jim and the Boys to get ripe. Hair and dark, warm areas are notorious for moisture and odor. (look at your arm pit) Here's something else that might be a contributing factor: the taste of your baby batter. If you take suppliments such as Ripfuel, or if you eat a lot of fast food or greasy foods. Or if your diet is high in saturated fats, you smoke and drink a lot, your yogurt will be toxic. Here's how to fix this: On Monday stop eating anything else other then Pineapples and water. That's right, you're now on a pineapple diet. The water will help clense your system and the pineapple will sweaten your taste. (( ladies, this works for you too )) By Saturday night after you've trimmed and shaved, showered and prepped yourself for lovin, tell her you've been doing something new to make things a little better for her down there. If she's a loving, caring, attentive wife she'll be atleast a little interested to see if there's a difference. If not and you unknowingly married an oral-hating wife (or she did the bait and switch by "loving it" when you two dated but "hated it" once you bought the farm) then you're stuck. At this point you should sit her down, explain all the trouble you went through and in a concerned and non-accusatory tone, discuss your desires and wishes for intimacy. (( Sometimes you have to give some oral to get some oral)) If she blows you off (and not the way you want her to) then you'll be at a crossroads of sorts with the left path leading to you just giving up any hopes of oral for the rest of your life or the right path to a girl on the side who has an oral fetish. Good luck!

O is a word in English, used as an interjection to indicate the vocative case, as in "O ye of little faith!" So, when it's used like that...as in O Lord or O Wise One, it means you are calling out to someone. \n\nO'clock is a different case. Here, it means of (or according to) the clock. This is just a shortened form of the original phrasing...like it's 5 of the clock.

I found a few websites that offer snorkels longer than 12 inches, but one in particular had this to say...\n\n"The length of a snorkel is only about 12 inches long. So why not just make longer and longer snorkels? If you tried to breathe through a garden hose while on the bottom of a swimming pool, you would find that you couldn't. The pressure pushing in on your chest and lung muscles is too great to allow you to take a breath."\n\nI imagine that's why 12 inches is the optimum length...unless you have really big lungs.
You weren't "robbed" of a wedding. You chose not to have a large wedding and reception. Giving yourself a wedding now -- after a year and a child -- is just tacky. Why not give yourself a first anniversary party instead?

Nov 28\nNews: Jones tested his injured ankle at practice Monday and pronounced himself ready to play this week against New England, the Detroit News reports.\n\nSpin: Sounds promising but plenty of players have proclaimed themselves healthy on Monday only to be downgraded later in the week. Fantasy owners shouldn't make a final decision on Jones until after the team's Wednesday practice. However, keep in mind that Jones has a tough matchup this weekend against a solid Patriots run defense.

If you go ~lawless~ there is no need for Grace because there will be no sin or imperfection to be forgiven. (God defines sin as transgression against His Law.) It is because mere humans cannot live up to God's standard for admission to heaven that we are at His Mercy to be saved by His Grace. (God's standard for entrance into Paradise is Perfection - the only One to qualify is His Son, Yeshua the Messiah - because He is sinless; He obeyed God's Law/the Torah, perfectly.)\n\nBeing lawless like Hitler or being lawless like Ted Turner* are NOT ways to obtain God's Salvation. Those who are rebellious to God's Laws are NOT ones who are seeking to do God's will "on earth as it is in heaven." His faithful believers are using their lives on earth, under His Law, as a preparation for living under His Law in the heavenly Kingdom of God. And based on their imperfection to completely follow the 100% Torah-observant Messiah who said, "Follow Me," they will be imputed with the Righteousness of the Son of God - perfection - on Judgment Day... & will be ready to enter into their eternal reward.\n\nIt is a simple plan which worked for Abraham & still works the same way for you & me today:\n\nTrue Faith + God's Grace = His Salvation\n\n~~~\n\n*Not to be judgmental with Ted... he has publicly stated that he wants to go to hell because heaven sounds "too boring."
I have health insurance, but it costs me 50 bucks a week. Where as my boyfriend does not. He can't afford it at the job we are at, but the state says he makes to much to get free health. And to get partical, you have to pay a $1700 dectable...his bills aren't even that much. So i guess you have to be completely poor to get any health help. We had to take him to the ER and now he owes $1200. Health in this country is so unbelievable. I can't believe that they will give an immagrant free health and not help out a citizen that has been here all his life working his ass off. Friggen messed up. You can go to any other country and the health is sooo much cheaper..gah...sorry, I could go on all night :P

Good question. I leave in the dark and come home in the dark and it's not nice. I always make sure I go outside at lunchtime and get some natural light. On days like today it's lovely to go out. \n\nI also eat lots of chocolate! That always helps. \n\nOther things that help keep me happy are to have days off to look forward to, my birthday, which is in winter, and then, after the winter equinox in December it starts to get light again! Its makes me happy every day to realise that we're getting a few extra minutes of light every day.

Most of the time, you can transfer nearly all of the credits from an associate's towards a Bachelor's. You would need to check with the college you're thinking of going to and have them do a transcript analysis...they'll look at your grades and see which classes they'll accept for towards your bachelor's.
If you're talking about Singapore, Yes. It's damn easy to monitor 4 million ppl. EZ link card, handphone, internet, you're being tracked everywhere. They know where you board your bus, where you alight at, they know who you called, how long you talked. Even if you call taxi they'll keep track your journey. How much you used your handphone, your gas, electricity, they know all, they know if you're rich, poor, what you just bought for your home from IKEA, they know if you traveled to Middle East country.\n\nalamak, you can't escape.

There is no reason to be if it doesn't feel right to you. Just tell them to back off and not pressure you. If they are as good of Christians as they think they are, they will. If not they aren't really the friends they profess to be and distance yourself from them.
Since you (or just about any other internal auditor for that matter)are not an expert in the area of marketing, it would be hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the markerting function. However areas that internal auditors can examine might be:\n1. Are there policies and procedures that the marketing deptment follows, and is the department following them?\n2. Does the department get the advertising that is being paid for? \n3. Are there contracts in place with vendors that are used frequently (this can help the department get the best pricing possible)\n4. Is there a review and approval process for various activities that the department may undertake.\n\nThose are just a couple.....i would probably look at the department and try to think of things that they could mess-up and then what are the controls that could or should be in place to prevent those mistakes/errors.
It depends on what the terms are for the account. Some will let you go over and some will not. Read the very tiny small print when you get your first credit card to see.
Blue is used on black in cartoons for the hair. It helps to add texture to the hair and show which way it flows. You know how in cartoons they're outlined in black? And they use black lines in hair to show the wavyness and so forth? Well, you can't use black on black, right? You coulnd't see it. So... they use blue instead.\n\nYoure shoes are the huge ones clowns wear that are red, or they're your pink, fuzzy, bunny slippers.
I completely agree. I once said (in an English class) that people are going to look back at this day and age and laugh because we believed in Jesus. People got mad at me, but eh. As a child I was told that there was an Easter Bunny, a Santa Claus, a Tooth Fairy, and a God. I believed because that's what children do, but as I got older I learned to question these beliefs. I am so tired of Christians telling me they believe in God because that's what they're taught and that's what's in the bible. Learn to think for yourself.
Yes! It basically means dont always put things on others, take responsibility for things yourself and deal with them rather than using excuses.\n\nI.e dont ask to be given a lighter load to carry (dont whinge about problems) rather, ask for a strong back (Ask for the strength to deal with the problems yourself).\n\nThe power of positivity. It really is the way forward, dont we all hate to listen to people moaning about their problems all the time? Those people should be taught this when they are at school! lol\n\nThere you go!

I always felt the same way and I did pretty good. I also realized that if I felt really good about an upcoming test, I usually didn't score well. When I stressed over it, It made me study more. Soon, I realized that this was a good thing. \n\nWorse case scenerio, you dont pass. But the sun will still shine, you are alive and well, and your friends and family will still love you. It does not make you a bad person. \n\nTry listening to music when you study. This way your distraction is only the music.

What do you mean, first? We lie to women from day 1, right through to the day of the divorce/funeral. All you New Age twonks out there know I am telling the truth, and it doesn't matter if you don't want it to be true - we men lie to women all day, each day every day. We lie to you because we don't want you to know what we've been up to, of course, but a lot of the time we lie to you because that's what you want. You've decided what you want to hear and we just feed it out to you. We also lie to you with empty flattery because that's the best way of getting your knickers off. We lie to you a lot because it's the line of least resistance - it's easier to come up with some stupid line of bollocks than it is to get into an argument with you about trivia. We lie to you and we are going to keep on lying to you until the end of time. Take it or leave it.
Getting burned means someone took advantage of you or got over on you. Something that stings really bad. A three way script usually means two men(or women) and one woman (or man). One of them is going to be left out, he or she is going to get burned. In the song, she has moved on, and he doesn't know why.
Maybe he is satisfied, a lot coaches work those 12-18 hour days so that they can get the right. Cowher has his ring, perhaps Bettis is right, come the end of this year, Cowher will move to the Carolinas and retire.

The first place to start is by filling out the Federal Application for Student Aid. This form is sent to the school you are attending and you are then considered for institutional aid as well as government aid. If you indicate your interest on the form, you will be considered for Pell Grants, Federal Work Study, Stafford Student Loans as well as scholarships. How much money you receive will depend on how much money you make and how old you are. For instance if you are 19 years old, unemployed but your parents are rich doctors, you will not be offered grants (free money) but you will be offered parent loans (loans mom and dad have to pay back). 22 is the magic age where your parents income is no longer a part of your FAFSA, unless you qualify for one of the special circumstances such as you are a ward of the state (orphan), you were adopted or you are no longer a legal dependent of your parents (not tax dependent, legal dependent). If you are a parent or have dependents that will help your chances of getting grants. You have to apply for a PIN first, then you can submit your information to the FAFSA folks. Check out http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ and your school's financial aid site for more information. Merit based (GPA, volunteer work, etc) scholarships are awarded by the school and not the government.

Both parties are prone to overspending because of the nature of our political system. However, the Bush era has certainly made it difficult for a rational person to see the Republicans as fiscally conservative. \nI guess as long as they try to keep taxes low and disregard the impact on the deficit, they think they are conservative.\nThey can still point their fingers at the "tax and spend" liberals who want to have a better balance between revenues and expenditures. For my money, I'd rather raise taxes than run up the kind of deficit we now have.\nIt's also the case that Republicans in general do not mind spending on the military and on corporate aid. They just don't like the evil "social" programs. Objectively, the rich have gotten richer during Bush's reign, and that seems quite okay with the Republicans.
A monarchy is a form of government- with a king or emperor- some kind of inherit-able leadership.\n\nA dynasty can happen in a monarchy. It is a period of time. It's when one family rules a nation for a long period of time. Usually, a dyansty (a long period of one family's holding the throne)has a definite influence on the nation's culture, art, etc.
A good punch is a full body movement. A powerful punch comes more from your legs, shoulders, and stomach, than from your arms. Get a heavy bag, and just work on punch combos for a week or two. Don't go full force, because if you haven't done much boxing your wrists won't be able to handle the stress at first. Do lots of push ups and sit-ups. Doing push ups on your knuckles will also help get your wrists stronger. Once you have some speed, then start working on adding power. A jab is to stun, and its just a quick hit. When you want to do damage you want to use more weight, and drive the punch into them for optimal damage.\n\nDo like a right jab, left cross, right power, solid left to the body, then a power right to the stomach, as they hunch down from having the wind knocked out of them, just give them a right cross from your elbow. Boom, fights over in about a second flat.\n\nReally tho, fighting should always be the last option. If you are an experienced fighter, you can do lots of damage with a single blow. Fights rarely last anywhere near as long as they last in movies, or boxing. A single solid un-gloved hit to the head will end most fights.... One good hit can cause... Detached retina, broken nose, broken teeth, lockjaw, and even damaged hearing.

Interesting question.\n\nSure there would have been far less wars, but then again both world wars had nothing to do with religion.\nThere wouldn't have been any witch burnings, but people would still have been hung, or tortured or killed for stealing to survive or for looking at a monarch the wrong way. \nSure you wouldn't have people knocking at your door hoping to shove the bible or whatever down your throats. Instead you'd probably get some scientist trying to verify his theory about where the world came from, and how we really are floating on the back of a giant turtle!\nThere would be less murder, but would there be less compassion?\nLess rasicsm? Not by much. \n\nThe annoying thing about religion is, we need it. There are those amognst us who don't, but the majority do. Without it people wouldn't live as long, wouldn't be as happy, life would have no purpose, no meaning, those who seek the easy answer would never find it. \n\nThe idea of God is a great one, and his main message is pretty good too. The only problem is all the other shit that gets mixed up with it, people are human, and humans are corrupt, therefore there will always be those who will use religion as a way of controling, or surpressing, or going to war. \n\nBut people have survived thanks to religion, if you ask the question would there be anarchy and sin ruling the world without religoin, my answer would be slightly different...But you didn't ask that, so...In answer to this question. No I don't think the world would be a better place without religion. But I don't think it would be choas. It would just be slightly worse.

Racism is alive and well in USA and in many other countries. And if you are going to have an interracial relationship, then you have to be prepared to deal with racism. \n\nAnd if you get married and have racially mixed kids, then they too will have some difficulty dealing with racism. It's hard for such a kid to choose sides when his black friend says something against the white folks or his white friend says the same against the black people.\n\nBut I think that interracial friendship and marriage is worth fighting for. You only need to take a look at such people as Tiger Woods and Hale Berry to see what good such relationships can bring. \n\nIf your man is better than anyone else you know, then don't listen to your mother and settle for second best. You have only one life to live and you must make the best of it, regardless of what other people say.

Public schools are subjected to state and local laws, so they may be different from state to state, local to local...\n\nIn the case of a student being displined by being placed in a locked room, that would depnd on a number of things I suppose.\n\n- Was the student supervised or alone?\n- What precautions were taking in the case of an emergency (medical, fire, etc.)\n- Was the environemnt hospitible (not hot, poorly ventilated or dark)\n\nDepending on your answers, the school may or may not be subject to punititive sanctions if they put children at risk, irrespective of the reasons. But in and of itself, a locked door doesn't necessarily mean the school's administration did anything illegal.\n\nIf you're still concerened, you should ask the district to provide a copy of a written policy for disciplining student. This then would allow you to see if they're following their own rules.

God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail.

But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.
It is the only reality show we like. Our favorite season was the one with Rupert, Big Tom, and Johnny Rotten. Rupert stole my heart when he stole the other teams shoes on the first episode, it was a pirate thing. They had really great characters that season, it was the best.
It used to be with old hard drives you had to park the heads before you moved the computer. With the newest models of hard drives, they automatically park every time power is disconnected. So now you just have to make sure all the cables are disconnected, and everything is packed securely without a lot of rattling.
It always amazes me how bilical literalists are so quick to claim (falsely) that there is no evidence for evolution, yet conveniently neglect to mention that there is NO evidence for the literal creation account taken from Genesis.\n\nAll creationist arguments boil down to either...\nAppeal to Ignorance (You don't know, therefore my theory is correct), \nAppeal to Incredulity (I can't imagine how the Archer Fish could have evolved, therefore they must have just magically appeared out of nothing). \nAppeal to Authority-This is often lead into by quote mining. Usually these quotes are from evolutionists, but the text is handpicked by creationists to give the reader the impression that a leading academic is doubting his own work. Sometimes, the quote is from a creation "scientist" whose seeming academic acheivement makes his or her judgment trustworthy. In any case, it is still a fallacy because scientists do not accept evolution just because Darwin, or anybody else, says so. They simply agree that the theory best explains the evidence.\n\nHalf truths-Scientists do have an explanation for how the archer fish developed its "firing apparatus." Even if they didn't, it wouldn't be proof of literal creation. Many fish have mouths, roofs of mouths, movable tongues, and binocular vision. The oldest fossilized fish had no jaw. When creationists discover the fossil of an archer fish, buried unintrusively in the same age of gelological strata, then maybe they'll have evidence.\n\nand OUTRIGHT LIES! Darwin never recanted on his death bed.\n\nAnyway...\nJesus wouldn't need to have anything explained to Him. He is God in the Flesh, and as such, He would know all that The Creator knows, including the evidence for evolution and whether or not it was correctly interpreted.\n\nHis response would be the same, whether it was a creationist, a theistic evolutionist (like myself), or an atheist...\n\n"As long as you all engage in these petty, unnecessary, immature squabbles about what the Bible SAYS, you will never get to understand what it MEANS!! I CREATED you because I LOVE you! I DIED for you because I want you to LIVE with me, eternally!!\nYou need to know WHY. You need to understand WHY. You need to accept WHY!\nIt doesn't matter HOW all of this was done.\nIt was done for YOU! That's all you need to know."

Also, most DVD's are dual-layer, using up to 8.5GBs of space. DVD-R discs are all single layer and limited to 4.7 GBs. If you have a dual-layer burner, make sure you're using dual-layer media. If there's no copyright protection, or your burning software ignores it, it should burn fine. Otherwise you'll need a DVD ripping application to trim the video down to 4.7GBs.

Yes, but it depends on the terms of your settlement.\n\nThey will make a strong case for interest because its how they make money.\n\nYou have to remember that if they are going to allow a settlement, then they are giving up on getting back some of the money.\n\nIt was money they gave you and you didn't really deserve because you didn't pay it back.\n\nThey should have the right to get some interest on that.

Vanilla is a flavoring, in its pure form known as vanillin, derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla from their seed pods..Madagascar is the world's largest producer.Though there are many compounds present in the extracts of vanilla, the compound predominantly responsible for the characteristic flavor and smell of vanilla is known as vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). Another minor component of vanilla essential oil is piperonal (heliotropin). Piperonal and other substances affect the odour of natural vanilla.\n\nVanilla essence comes in two forms: the actual extract of the seedpods, and the far cheaper synthetic essence, basically consisting of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. Natural vanilla is an extremely complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, versus synthetic vanillin which is derived from phenol and is of high purity.

When they sent you back to me I thought you sucked so I tossed you aside, but since you were my work, I thought I could fix you. So I edited you by fixing problems, but by fixing them, more problems were exposed. I tried to lengthen and shorten you to make you sound better. I tried to give you "better dress" but all I had was "home-spun cloth" which is to say, I tried to make you sound better but my imagination wasn't up to the task. At last I sent you out lookin pretty bad, so I hope you don't fall into the hands of critics. So go out and be read by people who haven't seen you and if they ask who your father is, say I don't have one. If they ask who your mother is say that she was broke so she sent me out unfinished, so she could maybe make some cash.

The Sens play an uptempo hockey that relies on accurate passing and quick skating.\n\nDuring the regular season, teams have limited opportunity to scout each other due to the crazy tight schedule. During the playoffs you play the same team, and you have tons of time to break down the opponent on tape and see what they do, pick their plays apart and discover other weaknesses. Buffalo, which is one of the most defensively sound teams in the NHL were able to shut down the Sen's passing game and slow down their attack. THey also managed to exploit the big ice surface that opens up as a result of the lightning quick Sens' forwards and their not so quick defenders, when getting puck possesion.\n\nAnother important point is that the level of officiating has changed dramatically during the play-offs, no doubt. What was hooking, holding and interference during the regular season is now washed out. This did affect the Sens' in that their forwards were not able to skate into open ice as quickly as they had done during the season, nor did they enjoy as many powerplays as a result of outskating and outpassing their opponents, but such is life in pro-sports.\n\nThere is of course more reasons to why Buffalo won... cause they did.. much more than the Sens lost, if that makes any sense. But I suggest you get on a hockey forum like www.hfboards.com, or something like that if you want to dig deeper into this.

Very good question, in fact the smartest one I heard in a while. I have to agree to a certain degree, by definition a real think-tank can not afford to be limited in its intellectual scope, so conservatism and a think-tank can not really go together (just like a communist think-tank, or an Islamic fundamentalist think-tank). You may limit your thought process within the realm of what ever ideology you want to but that would not be a think-tank but a project group at its best

http://www.aamc.org/students/cim/start.htm\n\nthis is a nitty gritty website. The basic process requires an individual to complete a 4 year college education with at least a B+ average. Although majoring in science is not necessary, the college student must take 2 courses in Biology, two courses in Chemistry, two courses in Calculus, two courses in Organic Chemistry and a few other must have courses such as Physics and statistics. Then you must apply to a medical school, complete 4 years of med school and then train an additional three years after med school to become a pediatrician. Med school tuition costs range from 15,000-45,000/year.

Here is a recent news article that explains why:\n\nThe Toledo OH-based company, which makes brakes, axles and other parts, has been in a downward spiral since it announced in autumn 2005 that it was restating earnings and lowering its profit forecast for the year because of accounting errors. In January, Dana said it lost nearly $1.3 billion in third quarter 2005 while realigning its business. \n\nThe company, which has 46,000 employees worldwide, said it filed for Chapter 11 protection so it could fix financial and operational problems. The filing, which was entered in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, does not affect its businesses in Europe, South America, Asia, Mexico, or Canada. \n\nDana supplies parts to General Motors Corp and other automakers. \n\nMichael Burns, Dana chairman and chief executive officer, said the company will move forward with its restructuring plans. \n\nThe firm that began as Spicer Mfg Co took on its current name in 1946. Dana in 1998 bought axle and brake maker Echlin Inc in what was one of the biggest mergers in the vehicle parts industry. The move increased its overall employment to 79,000 workers.

Salt actually lowers the freezing point of water. So when it's 25 degrees out, at the usual temperature of 32, the water freezes. But when you add the salt to the roads, the water's freezing point drops below 32 degrees and thus, the ice "melts".
Rather than taking out a $25,000 loan, try setting up a repayment plan. By incurring further debt, you are laying the foundation for another bankruptcy. Contact each of your debtors, tell them your situation and then tell them how much you can pay them each month. Most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to repayment. If there are interest rates involved, ask that the interest rates be reduced while you try to pay the money back. In the long run, this is a far better solution than incurring more debt.

Air of course we can not see, so at least to humans it seems to be clear. As for the sky...\nhttp://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html\nhttp://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Why%20is%20the%20sky%20blue%3F\n\n"Contrary to popular belief the sky is not blue because of refraction.\n\nRefraction is not a significant enough effect to have this sort of affect although it can change the apparent position of the sun\n\nThe real reason why the sky is blue is due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh Scattering whereby blue light is absorbed by gaseous molecules in the atmosphere ( ie air ) and then re-emitted in a random direction. \n\nThus as white light from the sun travels through the atmosphere the blue light is scattered away from its original direction of travel, and some of it is scattered down towards us which causes us to perceive the sky as blue. \n\nThis is also the reason why the sun is yellow."

Here is an explanation from The Phrase Finder supporting the Saint Peter hypothesis:\n\n: : What is the origin/menaing For Pete's Sake?\n\n: Biblical origins. Think of St Peter. Think of the omnipresent medieval church and think of hitting your thumb with a hammer. You can't swear, else the local priests will have you up before the Bishop and the Lord alone knows what the outcome of that will be, so you exclaim, in appropriate tone of voice, "For Saint Peter's sake" and carry on erecting the shelves. This phrase was amended to "For Pete's Sake" in later, less religiously oppressive, times.\n\n: This is called a "minced oath," a substitution of a less offensive word.

It's me again! I think this is a facinating topic. I think home schooling can be very beneficial. I am glad I was not homeschooled though, as a value the memories of my high school experience. \n\nMy step-mother home schools her children. Her oldest son, my little brother (who is now 16) went to public school until the 1st grade. She decided to home school him (and the rest of her children that followed) because she did not like the school teaching the students about Halloween. She believes this to be a day of Satan. (That's another topic altogether)\n\nMy main concern for her home schooling my siblings is that, although, my step mother is a lovely person- she's not that smart. I suppose she is learning more about history, math and grammar as she goes along, but she really is flakey. Simple would be a good word for her.\n\nShe tells me that I HAVE to home school my children when I have them. I told her that I personally don't feel qualified to be a teacher (which isn't true, but I felt it was the only way for me to tell her I don't want to do that without hurting her feelings) and she actually told me that "It's not about education it's about loving your children longer."\n\nThe good aspects of home schooling can be things like more one on one time with the "students", class time is in a controlled environment, field trips whenever you want, honing in on a child's best subject to really develop what the child is good at doing, etc... I'm sure most home schooling parents are quite capable.\n\nThe negatives are slightly more superficial, but those can be missing out on extra-curricular activities like playing for your school's team, being on a debate team, going to dances, passing notes in the hallways, pep rallies, etc... those things are important too. (my half-sibling do play for a soccer team, but they will never know the feeling of school pride, wearing the school's colors etc...)\n\nI also feel time apart from one's parents for a few hours a day with one's peers is important. Sure, there are activities home school kids get to go to without their parents, but in a school environment, there's the aspect of being expected to make decisions and mistakes without having mom and dad right there. My sister is 15 and still doesn't like being away from her mom- ever. She told me that her mom told her that she never has to leave home- for college or to get a job if she doesn't want to. I think she is too dependent, and it worries me.\n\nAll in all, I am not against home schooling, it's just not something I want to do with my future children. I applaud all those who have the time, patience and the financial freedom to be able to do it.
Yeah!
What's the legal citation? \n\nTo mortgage is to pledge property as security for a debt. Taking that construction, Bennet would be the pledger or mortgagor. \n\nHowever, this sentence could've been improperly constructed to mean that Bennet allowed Davis to take possession of the shop and requesting payment over a term, with the shop as collateral.\n\nContext matters, so the legal citation would be helpful.\n\n\n\nedit: \nLOL @ the guy above. Nice name too. Maybe you'll learn a bit more in business law 102. Or maybe secured transactions.\n\nsecond edit:\nAfter seeing guy below's answer, I just really want to say this: Can you all pleeeeaaasseeeee look up the definition of mortage (as a verb) before answering this freggin question?

Logic is the main requirement, even though the course probably deals with it to some extent. A familiarity with the concepts of calculus is good, but a real analysis class will be devoted to *proving* the results from calculus. The idea of a formal proof is crucial and logic will help with that.

I'm not sure of who invented "that rule", but think of it like this: When you burp, you shouldn't just belch out and act like nothing happened, you should say "excuse me". It isn't really rude to "fart" because man or woman or whatever race you are, we are all humans and that isn't unusual, but if you do fart, you should say "excuse me" or "sorry", instead of laughing at it and doing it to aggrevate.

Asthma attack:\nSevere wheezing when breathing both in and out\nCoughing that won't stop\nVery rapid breathing\nChest pain or pressure\nTightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\nDifficulty talking\nFeelings of anxiety or panic\nPale, sweaty face\nBlue lips or fingernails \nRecognizing Asthma Triggers \nAsthma triggers are everywhere in our environment: indoors, outdoors and in the very air we breathe. Identifying triggers, however, is not always simple. It usually involves a process of elimination. A good place to start is a consultation with your doctor. Ask for guidance. Your doctor may recommend a skin test for allergies.\n\nA vast range of triggers can set off symptoms of asthma. Chief culprits include dust mites, air conditioning (which cycles offending substances into the air we breathe) and cat dander. Individual asthmatics, however, tend to have their own "red-alert" triggers.\n\nCommon Allergic Asthma Triggers\nThe following is a partial list of common asthma triggers:\n\nalcohol \nair conditioning \nanimal saliva and urine \natmospheric ozone \nbetel-nuts \nbird, dog and cat dander \nchemicals (e.g., hexachlorophene, formalin, ethylene diamine) \ncockroaches \ncold air \ncolds and upper respiratory tract infections \ndrugs (especially aspirin, cimetidine, antibiotics, beta blockers) \ndust mites & their droppings \nemotional upset \nexertion (especially if strenuous and in cold air) \nfood additives or preservatives (e.g., tartrazine, sulfur dioxide) \nfungal spores \nfumes (e.g., paint) \ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD) \ngum acacia \nhair particle proteins \nhigh humidity \nkapok and feather fillers (e.g., in pillows and cushions) \nmetals (e.g., cobalt, platinum, nickel) \nnuts \nplastics \nPVC \nragweed pollen (particularly in the U.S.) \nrubber \nsawdust (especially oak, boxwood and cedar wood dust) \nshellfish \nsmoke pollution \nsolvents \nstress \nstrong odors \ntemperature/humidity changes \ntobacco \ntree and grass pollens. \n\n\nCommon cold:\nThe symptoms of a common cold include sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, and mild general symptoms like headache, feverishness, chilliness, and not feeling well in general.\nCold symptoms are due mainly to the body's response to the infection. When a nasal cell is infected by a cold virus, the body responds by activating parts of the immune system and some nervous system reflexes.\nColds last on average for one week. Mild colds may last only 2 or 3 days while severe colds may last for up to 2 weeks.
Its very heartfelt, it evokes pride in our armed forces and appreciation of their sacrifices.\n\nThanks for sharing.
Piccadilly (pĭk'ədĭl'ē) , street of the City of Westminster borough, London, England. Starting at Piccadilly Circus (London's center of traffic and amusement), it runs to Hyde Park Corner. The street is lined with shops, hotels, and clubs. The Albany, a club, was the residence of T. B. Macaulay, W. E. Gladstone, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Canning.\n\nThe name arises from a tailor named Robert Baker, who owned a shop in The Strand in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling picadils (stiff collars with scalloped edges and a broad laced or perforated border), that were then in fashion. With his great fortune he purchased a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London and in about 1612 he built a large house there. The mansion soon became known as Piccadilly Hall.\n\nThere was a British film made in 1929 called "Piccadilly".\n\n\nPiccadilly is a major London street, running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east. The street is part of the A4 road, London's main western artery, and runs alongside a number of famous buildings and sites, including Green Park.\n\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy and The Ritz Hotel. Simpson, once amongst the nation's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now occupied by the booksellers Waterstones.\n\nThe Piccadilly Line of the London Underground takes its name from Piccadilly and part of the line travels under Piccadilly. Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus tube stations all have entrances either on or near to Piccadilly.\n\n\nPiccadilly (1929) was a British film directed by Ewald André Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Anna May Wong, Gilda Gray and Jameson Thomas. It has been re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration. It appeared in theatres in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005 it was released on DVD.
First of all go to the doctor. Do not try to treat yourself without knowing what you have first.\nIf you are experiencing excessive thrist (polydipsia), lots of trips to the bathroom to urinate (polyuria), excessive hunger (polyphagia), lost of weight and fatigue you could be experiencing signs and symptoms of diabetes.\n However, other hormonal imbalances can cause thrist as well.\n\nGood luck!

How old are you?\nIf you don't want to be looked at as someone you're not then you better start figuring out who you are! It's easy to tell that you have no clue. If you did you wouldn't be wanting to run from this situation. \nYour priority right now should be to focus on just that-- finding out who you are. Naturally this takes years and years, but you can jump start this by:\nConcentrating on improving your health, body, mind, spirit, and soul.\nGet a better education\nVolunteer and help those less fortunate than you are\nTake some "fun" classes\nRead some self help books\nKeep a journal\nPray daily\nLearn to be more musical\nWrite about fifty essays beginning with the words "I believe..."\nSpice up your social life by getting involved in some new activities or clubs (not party clubs-- clubs that promote growth and learning) \nJoin a yoga class.\nMeditate daily.\nWrite a list of the principles you call your own and hold most dear\nStart a new exercise\nConcentrate on learning and loving YOU for now.\n\nAnd about the ex:\nIf you have kids together your s.o.l. You are stuck together for life to one degree or another unless-- God forbid-- something happen to the kid(s).\nIf you don't have kids together then just grab hold of... your courage... and tell the lady you are moving on. Tell her you tried. It didn't work. You see now that it will not work. You do not need her drama games. You are going to stop contacting her. You want her to stop contacting you. And you should both move on with your lives and (eventually) see other people.\nBut be sure this is what you want before you do it!\nHave you guys tried counseling? \nP.S: Don't date the 38 year old... Why?\n1. It's TOO SOON!\n2. She's an opportunist and probably a barracuda (gold digger/clingy emotional drama game player and general sucker of men's time/money/etc.)\n3. Any 38 year old that tells you you're a "hottie" is trying too hard to be "hip".\nP.P.S: Don't date "girls". \nDon't date ANYONE until you stop calling grown women "girls".

"Electromagnetic radiation from space is unable to reach the surface of the Earth except at a very few wavelengths, such as the visible spectrum, radio frequencies, and some ultraviolet wavelengths. Astronomers can get above enough of the Earth's atmosphere to observe at some infrared wavelengths from mountain tops or by flying their telescopes in an aircraft. Experiments can also be taken up to altitudes as high as 35 km by balloons which can operate for months. Rocket flights can take instruments all the way above the Earth's atmosphere for just a few minutes before they fall back to Earth, but a great many important first results in astronomy and astrophysics came from just those few minutes of observations. For long-term observations, however, it is best to have your detector on an orbiting satellite ... and get above it all!"\n\nFor those frequencies that do get through, it's a lot cheaper to build the telescopes on the earth, even if you do need to put a lot of effort into correcting the wobble in the images caused by turbulence in the atmosphere. It's far cheaper to make a huge earth-bound telescope with fancy adaptive optics than it is to send up a space telescope... but you only get a few slices of the spectrum.

In the United States, separation of church and state is governed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and by legal precedents, some quite controversial, interpreting that clause. Although the Establishment Clause states that, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," the U.S. Supreme Court has long interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment (one of the Reconstruction Amendments) as making the Establishment Clause and other portions of the Bill of Rights binding on state and local governments as well. Many other democratic governments around the world have similar clauses in their respective constitutions.\n\nThe phrase "separation of church and state" does not appear in the Constitution, but rather derives from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to a group identifying themselves as the Danbury Baptists. In that letter, Jefferson referred to a “wall of separation between church and state.” James Madison, the father of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, wrote in the early 1800s, “Strongly guarded . . . is the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States.” Ulysses S. Grant also called for Americans to "Keep the church and state forever separate."

1.North Carolina\nHansbrough+the other NC sophmores+#1 Freshman class=championship (assuming they all develop even more and I think they will under Roy Williams)\n2.Florida\nIt is really hard to repeat. But they will be really good. Noah is a beast.\n3.Ohio State\nThad Matta is the most underrated coach! Now he will finally have really good talent with Oden and his freshman class.\n4.Washington\nI know they lose Brandon Roy, but they get the 2nd best center in high school, Spencer Hawes. Their other players I feel are going to develop as well. They will win the Pac 10 because UCLA loses a lot of players to the draft.\n5.Kansas\nTheir freshman class last year was good. This year, as sophmores, they will be better. Sasha Kaun will dominate in inside and Chalmers and Brandon Rush will be great on the perimeter.
In my opinion the best British sports car is LISTER STORM 99'.It is the best because it has a great speed (200+ km/h) and Lister has a very good handling tradition. Of course, I haven't driven it but I read it in several magazines.One more thing is that STORM has won many races in it's class back in time (1999).

You just need to look at countries where religious fundementalists have taken over to answer that one. Think about what the teleban were doing in afghanistan.

There were more than 18 hurricanes in 2005. However, there was a report released in Science Magazine in September of 2005 that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has nearly doubled (I believe the rise was actually 80%) over the past three decades, to an average of 18 per year. That doesn't exactly answer your question because the year wasn't over when that number came out, and it is an average, but that number made a lot of headlines. I think that annual average number of hurricanes may be your answer. \n\nThis is important because this is being tied to effects of global warming, and the threat of things getting even worse.

I know that there is feline HIV\nOverview \nFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes an infectious disease in domestic cats and cheetahs similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection) in humans. It attacks and weakens the bodys immune system, making the animal susceptible to infections and diseases that don't affect healthy cats. There is neither a cure nor a vaccine for FIV. Though eventually fatal, an FIV-positive cat can live for many years without any signs of illness. \n\nFIV is a lentivirus, a virus that causes slowly developing disease. \n\nPrevalence \nFIV occurs worldwide and its prevalence varies geographically. About 1.5% to 3% of cats in the United States are infected with FIV. About 5% of FIV-positive cats also have feline leukemia virus (FeLV). \n\nRisk Factors \n\nRisk factors for FIV include \n\nage, \ngender, \nillness, and \ntime spent outdoors. \nOlder cats are more likely to be infected. The average age of cats with FIV is 5 years at the time of diagnosis. \nAggressive male cats that roam and fight with other cats are more likely to be infected than females and nonaggressive males. \n\nSick cats are much more likely to have FIV. In the United States, about 15% of all cats that show clinical signs of another disease are also infected with FIV. \n\nFree-roaming cats are more likely to be infected than indoor cats. \n\nTransmission \n\nFIV is transmitted primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds. A mother cat may transmit the virus to her newborn kittens during gestation, passage through the birth canal, or nursing. FIV can also be transmitted through the transfusion of contaminated blood. \n\nFIV affects only felines. Some of the pathogens (i.e., bacteria, parasites) that cause opportunistic infections in FIV-positive cats may be transmitted from animals to humans and could cause illness in people with compromised immune systems. Not sure about dogs though....research it or call your veterinarian!! And I am also not sure if humans can contract HIV from animals? Although some people believe HIV developed in the human race after people in a third world country ate some infected monkeys, many years ago.

Seems to me that your selective memory is at work - recalling the times it was accurate and forgetting about those it wasn't. Some skill above climatology *may* be shown for the general seasonal trends, but it is certainly impossible to predict weather for specific days a year in advance. The way to test them of course is with verifications. For example, choose a region and use the observed data in it for each month to see how accurate their forecast temperature anomalies are. Do the same thing qualitatively for the daily forecasts (have to develop some accuracy criteria - e.g., if the forecast says cloudy & cool for a 4 day period, what type of weather would be considered accurate). Compare the latter with the zone forecasts from the National Weather Service. That takes quite a bit of effort if done properly, but sure beats an opinion based on a general notion.
x + y = 14 ...so ...x = 14 - y\n\nx^2 +y^2 = 130 ...plugging in x from above...\n\n(14-y)^2 + y^2 = 130 ...multiply out your products...\n\n196 -28y +y^2 + y^2 = 130 ...combining your y^2\n\n2y^2 -28y +196 -130 = 0 ....moving over the 130 \n2y^2 -28y + 66 = 0 ...dividing equation by 2\ny^2 -14y + 33 = 0 ...performing FOIL method and finding roots...\n\ny = (y-11)(y-3) = 0 ...y can be 11 or 3\n\nIf y is 11, then plugging back into x = 14 - y...x is 3\nIf y is 3, then plugging back into x = 14 - y...x is 11\n\nSo your two number can be 11 and 3 \n\nActually, if you don't want to do the algebra...\n4x4 + 10x10 = 116 NOT 130\n5x5 + 9x9 = 106 NOT 130 \nand 2x2 + 12x12 = 148 NOT 130 \nso 3 and 11 can be your only solutions

It isnt the hardware, because OS X is now written for x86, the problem is that your laptop uses a standard BIOS, and the Mac OS requires EFI instead.

If you are in the United States and ship to India, you will be required by the Post Office to fill out PS Form 2976 Customs Declaration. In it, you will state the quantity and detailed description of the contents, weight and total value. The recipient on the other hand may pay custom duties on the item/s received depending on the rules of their postal services. \n\nSellers on eBay as well as other sellers anywhere on the Internet -- whether you use the post office, private shippers or customs brokers -- are all required to fill out the custom form when shipping to buyers. Ecommerce companies like Amazon and eBay sellers do not shoulder the custom duties for the buyer, as the buyer will have to pay for that. I know of Adsense publishers in England who received some techie gift goodies from Google last Christmas who were charged with duties on the items received. A buyer from the Philippines who purchases books from US-based Amazon may pay custom duties on the items received.\n\nMost of the small items that ship out are not inspected by customs, though there are countries (especially during holiday season) where they are more strict and inspect and open the packages received.\n\nHope this helps\nIsabel Isidro\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com

I wonder that everytime I see him. It looks huge!!! It also makes him look like he has no neck. His hair contributes a little to that. That may be why it is larger also, because he has so much hair it takes up more space than other players so he needs a bigger helmet. That's just speculation though. I have noticed it looks different than other players though.

India is too diverse to explain in a line. I'd say, population is not a problem now, its getting better now. The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India.

Divyank, marriage should be a commitment of ones love for each other...it sounds like your chosen partner is sincere but for the wrong reasons, she needs someone that can support her, that would be you, but her heart belongs to another...I understand in some cultures marriages are arranged based on who can be the best provider, but what I hear your words speak is that you also want a loving relationship too...and thats the part that I understand...I do not feel your going to get this from your partner...her accepting without loving you is one thing, that may develop later, however, accepting your proposal and already loving someone else may not ever change...you will live with a broken heart that she can not truly mend...everyone deserves to be happy...look for a partner who loves you...and allow her to seek her own happiness elsewhere...good luck.

As you probably know, it was mainly used only in high level electronics, especially in the aeronautics industry, until the widespread introduction of the catalytic converter where it is used as the catalyst to reduce smog components in automobile exhaust. This gives it quite an edge over other metals, a widespread application which actually uses up the material. However, its price in relation to gold has far outstripped its relative usage, and I think a lot of speculation is involved considering other possible applications such as fuel cells. I would expect increased demand through automotive applications for at least the next twelve years, by which time we may see some shift to new technology, but still at least level demand.

It actually depends if you are talking about a specific doctor which would then potentially be medical malpractice. However, if this is not happening directly to you then you would contact the AMA and report them. If it is regarding a hospital and it is general then you would need to have very specific details and proof prior to contacting someone at the State's Attorneys Office. I actually do medical malpractice and in order to file suit against a doctor in New Jersey you would actually have to send the medical records to a physician who specializes in this and that doctor would have to write an affidavit saying that they believe it be malpractice. This would have to be done after you seek legal counsel and prior to your attorney filing suit. I will tell you that if you are very concerned you could get a copy of the specific "Standard of Care/Policies and Procedures" find where they faulted in their care and then perhaps you would have better luck at the States Attorneys Office. It is very very difficult to file suit or to have charges brought against a hospital or doctor. If you have a story that you think is news worthy you could call your local news and they might do a story on this matter.

I'm taking a course at my local community college this summer. Since you already know so many languages it should be a breeze. I've been told Spanish is very similar.
The best bet is for you to contact a local college even a junior college will do and ask to speak to the Chemistry dept. chair or one of the organic chem. teachers on staff. I think that will give you them most reliable results, and it is probably safier to ask a professional about something as expensive as a GC.

The Robot Co-op has built a series of interconnected sites: 43 Things, 43 Places, and 43 People. \n\n\n43 Things lets you record a list of goals or dreams. The basic question you answer is, "What Do You Want To Do With Your Life?" 43 Places is a list of all the places you would like to visit. The place can be as specific as a particular store or as general as outer space. 43 People contains the list of people you would like to meet. Each site allows you to keep a record of the accomplishments, trips, and meetings you have achieved. Your entries can be as frequently as you like. You can also add comments to other's entries.\n\nWhen you visit other people's lists, you can choose to send them a 'cheer'. When someone sends you a cheer, it shows that they are supporting you in that particular goal.\n\nThe sites provide the functionality of uploading photos, integrate with an existing Flickr account, and be able to cross post content to your own blog elsewhere.

Most antidepressants take 6-8 weeks to completely kick in. Depending on what kind of Wellbutrin you're taking, SR or XL, the time of day does matter. If you only have to take Wellbutrin SR once a day, take it in the morning. If you are taking Wellbutrin XL, I would take it in the morning, if it doesn't make you too drowsy. But I don't think it makes that big of a difference. \nIf it doesn't work in the next few weeks, go back to your doctor. Some antidepressants don't work for some people. There are so many different ones and there may be a medication that works better.

It was pretty clear from the fact that you have asked this twice that you did not get the answer that you were looking for so here is my try !!!\n\nThe First Answers on the other question were good, but doppler was made a little bit clearer when put to me like this.When applied to Sound Waves. Have you heard a train horn coming toward you then away from you? The same horn at first sounds higher in frequency as the waves are compressing together in front of the train. Then as it passes, goes away the same horn sounds lower in frequency because now the waves are stretching out, reaching us at a lower rate per second this is the doppler effect. I only say a train because it is the only vehicle that usually single=horned you can hear clearly like this. A car passing if it blows it's horn will create the same effect and do the exact same thing. It's just not so noticeable.\n\nDoppler is how the Police catch you speeding! The early radar units were actually calibrated by the officers in the field using the back and forth motion of a common music tuning fork! (The back and forth motion of a certain note represented a certain specific MPH).\n\nDoppler really only refers to the change of frequency reflected from the target. If it is higher, then the target is coming toward the receiving antenna. If it is lower in frequency, the target is going away from the receiving antenna. The more the frequency shift, the faster the movement. \n\nConventional radar only shows the return signal, and does not measure its frequency shift from that which was transmitted.\n\nHope this helps you.\n\nThats basic Doppler 101\n\nThere is a Display (if it is a Weather type Radar) , a Transmitter / Receiver , Waveguide ( looks like square hollow copper tubing, conducts the radar signal ), Feed Horn (connects waveguide to antenna) Parabolic Antenna ( Focus signal into Feed Horn)\n\nBy the wayI just remembered in the days of space travel and satelites. When we tune in satelites the frequencies change as the satelite moves due to this doppler effect. Now during re-entry when speeds are greater the shifts are noticeable. And you can actually tell a difference from a ground station on the same frequency!\n\nOh yeah by the way no big problems with doppler, except that some operator could aim the darn thing wrong I guess and single out the wrong vehicle for speeding. Guess he would be cross eyed!!! Mistakes happen in just about every thing that is done everywhere! But doppler is very accurate people make mistakes. Some few Police are true JERKS most are just humans doing their job and are actually well meaning people trying to save lives!!!! If you feel you are unfairly stopped for speeding, now I mean you were really NOT speeding, calmly talk to the officer and just see what he can do for you. Explain Just BE CALM the worst thing will be he will give you the ticket! The best he will give you a warning! DO NOT ARGUE WITH HIM! Be sympathetic! It will work. OR HE IS A JERK!\n\nI AM NOT A JERK, AND I HAVE CARRIED A BADGE!\n\nHey have a good day. Hope I have helped you in some way!!\n\nOH YEA ... " DRIVE CAREFUL HEAR "\n\nAPS

ok! well i used to have the same problem, MAJORLY! I read heaps about this. One thing i never knew is that eye liner actually contributes to this, because it carries chemicals that go into the pores to give this effect- so try not to wear it often and ALWAYS wash your face really well.\n\nNow theres this stuff... i totally cant remember what its called! Well like its something like moisture boost or something? and its meant for putting under your eyes! it works really well! \n\nbecause the skin under your eyes is half the thickness of the rest of the skin on your face, so it is prone to dryness and bags.\n\nDo a search and read up about it.

I read the following from hoopsworld.com:\n\n"Ernie Johnson is one of my heroes and is simply in my mind one of the best of the television commentators in his role with TNT. The recent disclosure that he suffers and has been treated for a fairly common but somewhat mysterious form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma commonly known as a follicular type is surely a sad thing, but this is a type of cancer that people often live many years with and treatments continue to evolve. \n\nThis point was stressed in a statement released by the Atlanta Sports Network and also found on USA Today on the 22nd:\n\n"Two and a half years ago, in August of 2003, I was diagnosed with 'follicular' Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This is a low-grade and treatable cancer -- not as aggressive as some other forms...The only reason I'm bringing my condition to your attention now is because the swelling of a lymph node near my left ear has become noticeable to viewers of TNT and there have been questions asked." \n\nIn the same statement it was also mentioned that he plans to seek some additional treatment after the end of the year."

The Akosombo Dam is a hydroelectric dam in southeastern Ghana. The dam created the largest man-made lake, known as Lake Volta. The dam provides electricity to Ghana and surrounding West African countries.\n\n\nThe dam is 660 meters wide and 114 meters high. It was built between 1961 and 1965. In periods of drought, the water in Lake Volta is rationed and less electricity is generated. During these times, cities in Ghana are subjected to rolling blackouts to lessen their consumption of electricity. Ghana's Volta River Authority has contracts with neighbouring countries for electricity. These contracts are given higher priority than the customers in Ghana's own cities. Though Kaiser Aluminum is a major user, and the dam was constructed in part for the smelting of local bauxite, the economics have turned out such that raw materials have to be imported to keep the industry running.

Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed Salai or il Salaino and Count Francesco Melzi~both of these relationships follow the pattern of eroticized apprenticeships which were frequent in the Florence of Leonardo's day, relationships which were often loving and not infrequently sexual. \nBesides them, Leonardo had many other friends who are figures now renowned in their fields, or for their influence on history. These included Cesare Borgia, in whose service he spent the years of 1502 and 1503. During that time he also met Niccolò Machiavelli, with whom later he was to develop a close friendship. Also among his friends are counted Franchinus Gaffurius and Isabella d'Este, whose portrait he drew while on a journey which took him through Mantua.

Many men find parenthood optional. It is quite possibly related to the way they themselves were raised. My ex lives 1000 miles away and sees his kids once every two years. He doesn't see anything wrong with this because that's the way his father responded to fatherhood, and my ex doesn't think there is anything emotionally wrong with him. It's really rather sad, isn't it?

Well...my dear friend, I was very suprised to encounter your question. \nWell, my answer will be this, my dear good friend.\nDon't do it. Whatever will it takes...I advise you not to do it. Why? Well, if you truly loved her, then wait until the right moment (of course after marriage), then you can do it. If she mad at you for not doing it and accuse you for not showing you love to her...ask her what kind of love you two are having if it is only based on sex??? Normally, love based on sex always end up with nothing at all. In other words, both of you gain nothing but only a temporary pleasure. For the rest of your life, either or both of you will feel guilty to yourself, your partner, your family and even worst...to you future wife (whom you may yet to meet in the future). \nTherefore, for the sake of her innocency and of course YOUR INNOCENCY as well as PRIDE, my strict and bold advise to you will be NO. Don't do it. Ignore other people insults such as coward, virgin or so on merely because you 'failed' to take the good 'opportunity'. \nLike I always say to the others, think first and ponder about it before going through it and then regretting it for the rest of your life. ( I guarantee this one to you.) \nAnd again, such is only a temporary pleasure (believe me on this). Once you done with it, you may feel great (no one can deny this) YET...in one moment, you may feel regret about it. Even worst, you may regret about it for the rest of your life (I emphasize on this one before.)\nThus, my friend, you decide properly. The decision is upon yourself and it is for the benefit of many parties (you, your family, your loved one, and so on.).\nOne more thing before I end this advice of mine that I want you to think about...want is the use of having the dignity among men and women for being so 'brave' enough to have pre-intercourse if in the end its' purpose is only for pleasure and 'not-so-genuine-love'? Is it dignity for having sex for fun is more important than saving yourself from committing a sin? You know...the gate to heaven is too narrow. Even the slightest sin could cause one soul to be 'kicked' out from entering God's 'pub' (heaven/kingdom, of course).\nMy friend...it is for you to decide whether to do it or not to do it. \nGood luck.

So many people believe the Hollywood version of forensics that they fail to realize that crime undergoes a cost benefit analysis first.

In reality, it's not the hot water that actually KILLS the germs; it's the friction. When you wash, using mild soap all you really need is WARM water and lots of hand rubbing, or friction. This is what kills the bacteria. Hot, or warm water just feels better on the skin than COLD water...

What I find fuuny is one of the big arguments I keep hearing is "they come to our country and get free food stamps" when this is not true at all. I use to be a food stamp worker, and if you are undocumented (ILLEGAL immigrant) you do not qualify. Yes, they pay taxes when they purchase things. What I think annoys me the most is a lot of these comments are aimed towards Mexicans yet most other countries are welcome to come? What is that?

Mixing of the faiths? Fire and brimstone! *rolls eyes*\n\nOf course she should be allowed to date the non-Christian boy. Love transcends doctrine, and it does not come in limited supply: one's love for God should not prevent one from loving another human being.\n\nThe boy sounds like he is of good virtue anyway ("Christian" virtue, if you prefer), even if he is not of Christian faith, so I personally do not see any reason to forbid the two from dating each other.

No. Popular vote has nothing to do with it.\n\nThere are two methods:\n\nThe first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n\nThe second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.

At your young age, it would be best if you did not pursue marriage or children at this time; you will appreciate this advice later. You may be bi, know what you are and what you want in life before you start involving children.\nFollow your heart, ignore fundamental Christians. I'm a Christian, and think they are bigots and way off base. If you really feel f****d, then see psychological counsel who is educated, but not working through some church. Listen to his professional advice. Often one session would do. Also explore non-judgmental churches if you are Christian or interested. The Episcopal Church is a good place to start. They are welcoming and non-judgmental. Some things are definitely between you and God, not the large haired ladies, and wild fanatics that visit this room so often to spew hate. When in doubt, read John 3:16, feel secure and safe. Watch out for the bigots, they can be murderers while preaching love.

There is no way to answer this because EVA has some assumptions in it - specifically WACC. You will need to use an estimate for the Cost of Equity (Ke), the pre-tax cost of debt (Kd) and long run capital structure between debt and equity. Values will vary pretty significantly based on your assumptions. Ke should be somewhere in the high-teens to low twenties and cost of debt should be bootstrapped off the benchmark government long-bond. Unfortunately, I am not sure which one should be used, but I do know that Kd should be relatively high due to high interest rates in India.

That's really rough, I was in a similar situation in the 8th grade. I had gone to public school and then switched to a Christian school. It was hard cuz I left my best friends there, and I did lose touch with most of them. I see a few of them once in a while now. We talk cordially, but our lives went in completely different directions - I'm glad about that too, they're all 21-22 with kids. I guess my best advice to you would be to be nice - say hi, be like - hey we should do something sometime and catch up. Ya know, just play it cool like it doesnt' really matter either way.

Northern Ireland provides what it calls Smart Grants for small businesses. Here is a page listing how a small business entrepreneur can avail of these grants\n\nhttp://www.investni.com/smart\n\nStarting a small business takes a lot of courage. But, as they say, courage does not pay the bills. To be successful – to stay in business – you need more than courage. You need a combination of hard work, skill, perseverance, and lots of luck. \n\nSome things you need to consider:\n- "How can I support my family while I build up by business?" \n- "What are my abilities?" \n- "Is there a market for the product or service I have chosen?" \n- "How long will it take this business to reach the financial goal I have?" \n\nYou may want to read the article "How to Start a New Business Successfully" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol51/launch.htm , which lists six steps to launch a new business successfully:\n\n1. Provide a benefit.\n2. Determine the fit with your market.\n3. Right timing is everything\n4. Be ready to support your business\n5. Develop a blueprint for success\n6. Market, market, market\n\nI recommend that you read the following books:\n\n- What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business : Real Life Start-Up Advice from 101 Successful Entrepreneurs \n- Starting From Scratch: How To Start A Business When You Don't Have Money \n- If You're Clueless About Starting Your Own Business and Want to Know More \n- On the Move : How to Succeed and Survive As an Entrepreneur \n- How to Make 1000 Mistakes in Business and Still Succeed

Most people who know anything about science think so. When you say "eco-friendly" I assume that you mean "non-poisonous". The chief complaint would be that the stuff just does not break down. It takes aeons to break down. However, it is inert to your body and anything else alive. It is a super-long hydrocarbon which has no reactive functional groups whatsoever and hence can't really do anything other than burn. By the way - it's spelled polypropylene.

The simplest explanation:\n\nA seismograph is just basically a pen on a spring (although now days this is replaced by a sensor) It measures ground motion. Earthquakes, nuclear weapons tests, the impact of waves striking the coast, the rumble of trucks on a highway, volcanoes and many other things can result in ground motion that a seismograph can measure. Seismologists looking for oil can use vibrating trucks or underground explosions to send waves into the ground that seismographs can measure, and turn into pictures of what the earth looks like underground. \n\nOf course, this can get far more complicated. Some seismographs can measure lower frequencies, even using superconductivity, etc. Seismographs really measure ground acceleration, which is the second derivative of ground displacement.
I had a friend in high school that was like this. She said it was because she thought it implied that they can't do stuff for themselves. I tried to explain to her that it is just an expression of respect, but she didn't buy it. She would get really pissed off whenever I opened the door for her.

"Greater Avenues for Independence"\nGAIN aims to increase employment and foster self-sufficiency among people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). GAIN was originally mandatory for all welfare recipients except single parents with children under the age of six (and was later reduced to three under JOBS). Welfare recipients are exempt from remaining registered in the program if they obtain a full-time job or are chronically ill. GAIN’s regulations permit temporary deferral from the participation requirement for those who have a part-time job, temporary illness, family emergency, or another situation that precludes attending an activity.

nick's as told by ginger. :D\n\ni love the show, because it portrays well the life of a typical teen- aged (or pre- teen) girl, who gets caught in your average everyday problems, like having popularity issues, an at- times- hostile *in* crowd, separated parents, annoying little brothers, love and relationships, friendships, among many other issues. it's about trying to fit in, and finding out who you really are and how those around you help you be that person you want to be.\n\n~~ As Told by Ginger is an American animated television series which debuted on Nickelodeon in October of 2000. Produced by Klasky Csupo Inc. (the creators of the Rugrats media franchise), and created by Emily Kapnek, the show revolves around the life of Ginger Foutley, a typical junior high school student who lives in a fictional Connecticut community named Sheltered Shrubs. The show is unique, in that many of the characters have actual wardrobes (to save time and money most cartoon characters are almost always drawn wearing the same outfit).\n\nCharacters\nGinger Foutley (Melissa Disney), the main character, talented poet (there are two episodes that deal with poems she's written) and diary keeper (she's often seen writing in it), \n\nDeidre Hortense "Dodie" Bishop (Aspen Miller) and Macie Lightfoot (Jackie Harris), Ginger's two slightly dorky best friends, \n\nCourtney Gripling (Liz Georges), their rich and arrogant classmate who has been hanging out with Ginger. Courtney completely disappeared during the high school episodes. \n\nMiranda Killgallen (Cree Summer), who has been doing things to keep Courtney and Ginger apart (in the very first episode, she even has her arrested for stealing, after she recommended Ginger to do so for Courtney's birthday party). \n\nCarl Foutley (Jeannie Elias) and Robert Joseph "Hoodsey" Bishop (Tress MacNeille), Ginger and Dodie's younger brothers respectively, who tend to do weird things that are, most of the time, a given episode's subplot (for example, running a lunch cart), \n\nBlake Gripling (Kath Soucie), Courtney's younger brother, who occasionally tags along with Carl and Hoodsey, \n\nLois Foutley (Laraine Newman), Ginger's divorced mother, who works as a late shift nurse at a local hospital, \n\nDarren Patterson (Kenny Blank), Ginger's next door neighbor, who later becomes her boyfriend. \n\nalso, i love hey! arnold. and spongebob squarepants, and anime like boys be, gto, gundam wing among MANY others

Day dreamer is correct. The profile of the cable is produced with a twist. Distorting it to any other shape than a spiral requires energy, let the cable free and the stored energy used to distort it is used to relax the cable back to its natural shape. Try heating up any plastic object and you find before it goes back to a molten blob it will pass through other shapes ( the shapes it passed through when being produced). Its called inbuilt history. To the rather anal people this is a very general description based on the Q.

Let him shoot himself in his own foot or let it come out in due time.\n\nAnd why does this damn league keep opening a new wound to every damn book that is published...you are just giving that writer more publicity and money...and who even know if they are not lying to make an easy buck over a high publicized topic.\n\nOff the Soap Box
The key to football is not like any sport. Sports are about using your athletic ability to complement the game in hand. In football you use your brain more, and in defence this is more so. People are saying your good, and this proves you have the sporting ability.\n\nEvery time somebody runs at you with the ball (which will happen a lot playing full back) have a think about where hes going, and when hes going to put the ball in the box. Watch the ball and the feet, and get used to thinking quickly.\n\nAnother good tip for a full back is practice coming forward. You may be a defender, but it is good to support your wingers. Overlap them when they hold the ball up and practise your crossing so they can lay you off by the byline.\n\nStay fit and healthy, because to be a good right back, your going to need to get up and down the pitch. Im not sure what level your playing on, but anothe good tip is to listen to your coach. He may not always be right, but discipline will reflect on the pitch.\n\nAlso, try simple training methods;\njuggling- control\npassing against a wall back to your feet- passing and control\nskills- if your up to it, watch and try and repeat\n\nGood luck!

So her doc is thinking she may have Antiphospholipid syndrome, right? So this disease is diagnosed by checking for anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Antibodies have 2 main types: IgG and IgM. Since her IgG is increased it may suggest a rheumatic disease, like Anti-phospholipid syndrome, or it could be a ton of other diseases, that's why she should see a rheumathologist, s/he is more capable of making the diagnosis of a rheumatic or collagen disease.

Bring it up like you both know where the relationship is going. Because you both do. Don't play dumb about it.\n\nAnd that's it, really. It will work. We have a tendency to make these things bigger in our heads, then we look back and see that it was a small step instead of a large leap. Just give up, surrender...and do it.

Yes you will fined your love I am as cretin of this as I am that some day it will come to me there is some one for every one though we may be lonely now we just need to wait hold in a little longer for you never know what waits for you behind that corner up ahead
Those aren't valid points, and I'm not wasting my life, I'm living it for the creator of you and me. I think that you might wanna start seeing that.\n\n1. Intelligence is subjective. People who are mentally handicapped can be capable of things that we cannot explain, and people who are smart can have no common sense.\n\n2. If you mean "ignorant," then of course we are! It takes a lot of work to memorize the 66 books of the Bible, and people don't have enough time today to recite them word for word. If you mean completely oblivious, then you're dead wrong. All Christians have had Jesus come into their heart and that's the biggest part. The rest is doctrine, theology, and adhering to the Bible.\n\n3. I'm not a jerk, and I haven't slandered you. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be taking the time to write all of this.\n\n4. Lottie Moon was a missionary to China. She shared her faith with the people there, and empathized with them so much. She eventually was so weak from sharing her food with them and having little to herself that she wasn't strong enough for the journey back to the U.S. on a ship and she died. This is only one of many examples, but that would take a book to write.\n\n5.Well, aren't you placing blame on Christians? You are proving that you are no better than we are. Show me a completely wise person (Christian or not), and I'll show you that I can fly by flapping my arms.\n\n6.It's history, it's not just a book. It's inspired by God, and I try to live by it. There are many writings besides the books in the Bible that support this argument. Since the time of the book of Genesis, there have been Jews. Christianity is the fulfillment (or a continuation) of that faith. It dates back further than 2000 years ago. Jesus' birth was predicted.\nTruth is: nobody educated denies that Jesus existed, but there are those who don't believe he's the Son of God.\nTake a look at the prophecies of the Old Testament (basically the Jewish Bible) and see how Jesus hasn't gone against any of those prophecies.\n\nIf you just wanted a simple answer, then sorry. I only give those to questions which require a simple answer (or the really stupid questions like "how are you feeling today?" or "why is the alarm clock beeping at me?")

Steam Engine, mechanical device used to transfer the energy of steam into mechanical energy for a variety of applications, including propulsion and generating electricity. The basic principle of the steam engine involves transforming the heat energy of steam into mechanical energy by permitting the steam to expand and cool in a cylinder equipped with a movable piston. Steam that is to be used for power or heating purposes is usually generated in a boiler. The simplest form of boiler is a closed vessel containing water, which is heated by a flame so that the water turns to saturated steam. The ordinary household-heating system usually has a boiler of this type, but steam-generating plants used for power purposes are more complex in design and are equipped with various auxiliary devices. The efficiency of a steam engine is generally low, and therefore, in most power generation applications, the steam engines have been replaced by steam turbines \n\nSteam engines also improved significantly. In early steam engines, steam from the boiler was directed to a cylinder, where it drove the movement of a single piston before it was expelled. These single-expansion engines wasted some of the steam’s energy. More efficient double-expansion engines used the steam expelled from one cylinder to power another cylinder. By 1873 even more efficient triple-expansion engines came into use.

Based on the hit musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the tale tells the story of a disfigured musical genius who haunts the catacombs beneath the Paris Opera, waging a reign of terror over its occupants. When he falls fatally in love with the lovely Christine, the Phantom devotes himself to creating a new star for the Opera--exerting a strange sense of control over the young soprano as he nurtures her extraordinary talents.

One of the difficulties of looking at addictions within a "disease" model, is that from a rehabilitative point of view, it effectively absolves the person from any personal responsibility, as they have a "disease". Obviously, this is problematic in treatment, as it relies essentially on the person being motivated to change and taking some ownership of the problem, which is not the way the medical or disease model works. In medicine, things are done to people, i.e. they are treated, but when rehabilitating people with dependency issues, the opposite needs to happen, they need to take personal responsibility, otherwise they will go back to using. This is all part of an overall trend over the last 30 years, where medicine (and in particular, psychiatry) has attempted to classify what was previously seen as deviant behaviour and turn it into a "disease". It can be argued that this has led to modern psychiatry being more about social policing then actual treatment of mental health problems in the classic sense (such as schizophrenia, depression, etc.). However, as a final point, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that some people do have a physiological vulnerability to becoming addicted to some substances. Hope this helps!

It really depends on the person. Most teenage girls would enjoy makeup of some kind, or some relaxing candles or jewelry, as everyone knows. Adults(parents) enjoy it when you make something for them. It is easy to carve, glue, and paint a birdhouse. They sell birdhouses in most arts-and-crafts stores. With younger children, male teenagers, and younger teenagers, they appreciate it if you give them something that follows their interests. Or you can craft from clay. It is easy to buy the kind that drys, and then paint it. I don't suggest Crayola modeling clay, the kind in the plastic bag packaging. It tends to be very foamy, like springy Play Doe(How do you spell it?). Good luck on gift hunting!

From http://www.womens-health.co.uk/retrover.asp\n\nA retroverted uterus is the name given to a uterus that is tilted backwards inside of the pelvis. Normally, women are born with a uterus that is located in a straight up and down position inside of the pelvis, or with a uterus that tips slightly forwards, towards the stomach. However, some women have a uterus that tilts backwards, pointing towards the spine. Commonly referred to as a tipped uterus, this condition affects more than 20% of women worldwide. Generally associated with no health complications, a retroverted uterus can occasionally cause painful symptoms or signal an underlying health disorder.\n\nWhat Causes a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nIn the vast majority of women with retroverted uteruses, causes are completely genetic. Many women are simply born with a uterus that is tipped in this position, and this is entirely normal. However, certain factors can cause a uterus that is in a normal placement to become retroverted. These causes include:\n\nPregnancy: During pregnancy, the uterus becomes enlarged and the ligaments that hold the uterus in place become weakened. As a result, many women find that their uterus becomes retroverted after they have delivered their babies. \nMenopause: During menopause, estrogen levels drop rapidly in women. As with pregnancy, this can cause the ligaments that hold the uterus in place to weaken, allowing it to slip into a retroverted position. \nReproductive Health Problems: Certain reproductive health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis, can cause the uterus to tilt backwards. This is because these illnesses can lead to scar tissue formation on the inside of the abdomen, forcing the uterus out of position.\n\nWhat are the Symptoms of a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nGenerally, the majority of women suffering from a retroverted uterus experience no symptoms. However, if symptoms do present, the two most commonly-occurring symptoms include:\n\n\npain during sexual intercourse, particularly vaginal intercourse (dyspareunia) \npain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea)\n\nThis pain and discomfort is the result of pressure that the retroverted uterus places on the rectum and the ligaments around the tailbone.\n\nRare symptoms associated with a retroverted uterus include:\n\nlower back pain \nincreased number of urinary tract infections \nincontinence \npain while using tampons \nfertility difficulties\n\nDiagnosing a Retroverted Uterus\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of a retroverted uterus, you may want to make an appointment with your health care provider for an examination. By performing a few simple tests, your health care provider can easily diagnose the condition. Diagnosis usually consists of:\n\na pelvic exam \nan abdominal ultrasound\n\nOccasionally, it is difficult to differentiate a retroverted uterus from a pelvic tumor. In this case, your health care provider may have to perform a rectovaginal exam.\n\nAre There Any Health Complications Associated with a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nFew women with retroverted uteruses experience health complications as a result of their condition. However, sometimes a retroverted uterus can be a warning sign of another underlying reproductive issue, including pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis. Be sure to contact your health care provider if you are experiencing:\n\nsevere abdominal or pelvic pain \nirregular menstrual periods \nirregular ovulation or infertility\n\nIf left untreated, these conditions can have dangerous effects on your reproductive organs and overall health.\n\nWill A Retroverted Uterus Affect Fertility?\n\nMany women who have a retroverted uterus worry that it will affect their future fertility. However, this condition does not appear to affect conception in any way, and most women with retroverted uteruses will go on to experience healthy pregnancies. If you are experiencing difficulties getting pregnant, it could be a sign of an underlying reproductive p

SPH = SPHERE\n The amount of long or short sightedness. It always has a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign in front or above it. If the vision in one eye is very poor, the word 'balance' or 'bal' may be written. For example, i'm -3.00 in both right and left. So baisically, it tells you how blind you are\n\nCYL = CYLINDER (Astigmatism) This is the measure for astigmatism. Again, there is always a plus (+) or minus (-) sign present\n\nAXIS - This will only appear if there is a value for cylinder, as it relates to the cylindrical lens. It will be a number between 1 and 180. It may or may not be written with a degree 'o' symbol after the number. \n\n\nHope this helps
I know a girl who was molested by her stepfather while she was growing up. She doesn't like to be touched or played with. Her husband died recently and she's afraid that she can't get close to anyone ever again. I'm trying to cure her hangups but keep getting slapped or punched. Still I can't quit trying. She's worth the effort. I don't know how many other girls don't like it but my guess would be less than 10%.

Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\nZine El Abidine Ben AliZine El Abidine Ben Ali (زين العابدين بن علي; born in Hammam-Sousse on September 3, 1936) is the President of the Republic of Tunisia since November 7, 1987 and only the second one since its Independence from France on March 20, 1956.\n\n\nEarly life and training\n\nAs a young militant of President Bourguiba's Neo-Destour party, he was sent to France for military training. He graduated from the Inter-Arms School of Saint-Cyr and the Artillery School in Châlons-sur-Marne, and then continued his military training in the United States.\n\n\n\nGovernment appointment\nHe was appointed to establish and manage the Defense Ministry's Military Security in 1964, which he ran until 1974. General Ben Ali was promoted to director-general of National Security at the Ministry of the Interior in 1977 after serving as military attaché to the Kingdom of Morocco. He returned from four years as Ambassador to Poland to become once again head of National Security at the Ministry of the Interior but this time with Cabinet rank. He assumed this post at a time of increasingly radical Islamist activity. For his success in dealing with this threat to the regime he was promoted to Minister of the Interior, and retained this position until he was appointed Prime Minister. Many disappearances deaths and torture cases were reported to the human rights organisations.\n\nBen Ali was appointed Prime Minister and constitutional successor by President Habib Bourguiba on October 1, 1987. Only five weeks after becoming head of the government, he had President Bourguiba declared medically unfit for the duties of the office and assumed the presidency on November 7, 1987. The constitutional destitution of President Bourguiba was popular and legitimately based on Article 57, that allowed the procedure; the political life of the country having been deadlocked in an unending presidential succession debate and political crisis, cronyism and economic stagnation.\n\nHe then retained his predecessor's pro-western foreign policy and supported the economy which has been growing since the early 1990s. Big public works projects, including airports, highways or housing, have been undertaken. However, unemployment remains the biggest economic problem.\n\n\n\n\n[edit]\nWork as President\nBen Ali continued running the country with an iron's fist. Although he announced a fake political pluralism in 1992, his Democratic Constitutional Rally (formerly Neo-Destour party) continues to dominate the national politics and there is no genuine open political debate. In 1999, although two unknown alternative candidates were permitted for the first time to stand in the presidential elections, Ben Ali was reelected with 99.66% of the vote. Both candidates were arrested and sued for daring to challenge him. He was again reelected on October 24, 2004, officially taking 94.48% of the vote, after a controversial constitutional referendum in 2002 which allowed him to seek reelection and contemplate the possibility of remaining in office until 2014. Freedom of the press is officially guaranteed and condoned. However, human rights organizations state that no freedom of expression is evident in any of the authorized publications as honest criticism, public accountability and scrutiny of the government and it's ministers is totally absent. Cronyism and a mafia-like management style is the norm for running public affairs, and political dissent is not allowed. Jail and fines or confiscation of newspapers is very common, say human rights organizations. Many political prisoners remain in jails or in exile in and out of the country. Many arrests are a result of indiviuals venturing into the internet to bypass government propaganda and controlled press.\n\nHe was first married to Naima Kefi, the daughter of General Kefi, Tunisia's first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
Democracy means more than fair elections that represent the will of the people. \n\nThere are many definitions of democracy.\n\nHere are a few definitions:\n\nDEMOCRACY\n•Popular will; Rule by the people\n•Equal citizenship rights\n•Social contract among the people\n•Popular rule express and encourage to autonomy\n•Consist of moral compromise\n•Participation, election, liberties, check and balances\n\nThere are six types of democracy:\n\n1- Schumpeterian democracy\nDemocracy as “ that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of competitive struggle for people’s vote.\n\n2- Populist democracy - Popular will are:\n•Free speech, press and assocation necessary for political freedom\n•The rule of law, arbitary will of public officials\n•Formal voling equality\n\n3- Lıberal democracy\nHe indicates basic to idea of free and equal human beings:\n•freedom of speech, press, assocation and religion\n•right to property, freedom to vote,\n•hold public office and arbitary arrest.\nLiberal democracy contradicts tyrany of popular will; therefore, ıt encourages individuals. İndividuals are rather than whole. So, liberal democracy underlines check and balances and seperation of power for liberty.\n\n4- Participation democracy\nIt offers greater opportunities for citizens to participate direct in politics rather than indirect. So, it is called direct democracy which first used in encien Greece. Switzerland currently has the only Direct Democracy in the world.\n\n5- Social democracy\nIt tries to bring democracy into public life. Specifically, ıt considers family intercourse. For example, women and children rights in family, support family income in order to growth health children such as establishing child care center. Also, ıt gives democratic rights for workers. Workers have the right to participate in decisions in factory. As a result, social democracy is welfare state democracy.\n\n6- Deliberative democracy\nDeliberative democracy offers an aswer that integrates the populist and liberal ideas in order to dicuss an issue and find a solution. So, ıt encourages public deliberation an issues that are best understood through open , delibarete processes. While majority popular will gets to express their will, it also gives the minority the opportunity to express their feelings. It prevents minority rights from the majority tyranny because, ıts aim is to make a common decision.

have you ever heard the expresion"You have to be a friend to have a friend". Women can tell when a guy is seeking to find someone. I know that is hard to find someone in this day and time. Try to find someone that interest you. Don't always base your preference on looks. Start out by being friends.Spend time together with no pressure to date.That is a good way to get to know someone. No sexual contact or pressure.Sex always changes your relationship. If you can be friends then you have found someone to try and bring your relationship up one level with them.Do you know a girl that has the same interest in sports or art or what ever you like. And try to be honest in a relationship.Always speak your mind with love not sarcasm. I my self always found love when I wasn't looking for it!
It depends. Caucasion man and black girl, deffinte no.\nAmerican man and a girl of another nationality? A deffinite yes and good thing to do- depending on the nationality.

Well, depends. If he's at my bachelorette party, yes. But, if it's the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with, no. Muscular guys tend to be a little into themselves and very cocky.

Therefore, I prefer a guy who I love spending time with, and makes me laugh, because that is what will last forever, not his muscles. ;)
I think the difficulty in answering your question is that the term 'gay' is more a form of personal identification than it is of social identification. If you are physically a man who considers himself a woman, but is attracted to men, he may not consider him/herself gay, because on the inside, he is a female. Whether or not you're gay or male or female is defined by you and not by society. Anthropologically speaking, male and female is purely speculative. If you are unsure who you are or how you view yourself, I would definitely put any sort of surgery on the backburner. That's one of those mistakes that is not easily remedied. Just determine what 'gay' means to you, what gender you are and then you'll have your answer. Furthermore... Remember that if you do determine that you are gay, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

The Province of Canada declared that all accounts would be kept in dollars and cents as of January 1, 1858, and ordered the issue of the first official Canadian coins in the same year. The colonies that came together in the Canadian Confederation progressively adopted a decimal system over the next few years. Nova Scotia retained its own currency until 1871, whilst Newfoundland issued its own currency until joining the Confederation in 1949.\nFinally, the Federal Parliament passed the Uniform Currency Act in April 1871, tying up loose ends as to the currencies of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar. \nThe Aussies waited until 1966. They eventually did because they also saw the benefits of a decimal system. \nThe Kiwis followed in 1967 for the same reason.

Doesn't sound too good. Talk to him. If he is reluctant to answer you, then you need to tell him that. Explain what is bothering you so that it doesn't seem that you are getting upset over nothing. You have a reason to question what is going on becauseof the fact that he has slept with her in the past. He would be suspicious too if the roles were switched. If he keeps getting defensive even when you are open about your worries then you need to put your foot down because he shouldn't be keeping things like this a secret from you... Bottom line... he wouldn't be defensive if there was nothing to hide.
You are only allowed to either get them to stop trying to break in or incapacitate them. Killing them is rarely necessary. Though, if you do kill them in the process, as long as they went straight from breaking in to dead, you would not be liable.

Sounds like a lot of people have gay on the brain...hmmm...Clay is SMART. He has a motivated fan base and he knows how to get them talking. He is an amazing talent but he makes good choices, too. Ruben, I think, listened to the wrong people, and ended up alienating the very fan base that voted him American Idol. I love Ruben, but hated his first CD. I'm looking forward to his next CD, The Return of the Velvet Teddy Bear. Talk it there will be more Luther type songs.\n\nClay is here to stay, his voice is amazing, his demeanor is charming, he is SO NOT GAY, and most of all, he's SMART. He knows how to work this celeb machine.

1. In a democracy, the people rule. The people get to decide who their leaders are and how they want to be represented. In that sense, the people have a say in the way government runs. The laws and policies are the will of the people.\n\n2. In a democracy, the rulers must answer to the people. Not only are they elected by the people, but they must not overstep their bounds. This means that power is checked so that no one leader can become too powerful. In America, Presidents can only run for office twice, and they are liable to impeachment if they overstep their authority and commit "high crimes and misdemeanors". Most public officials in our American democracy understand that their powers are limited and the transition from one President to another is smooth and without violence. By contrast, in some countries where democracy is much more limited, the leaders use corrupt means to stay in power, and violence often erupts when a leader refuses to step down.

I think the poor woman should have been allowed to die with dignity a long time ago. I'm quite sure that she would not have liked all the drama attached to her situation as well as those "home movies" that were all over the news. It was horrible to see someone made to stay alive like that when she was really not "living" at all. If you polled a thousand people I don't think even one would say that they would have preferred to have their life prolonged when there was absolutely nothing to look forward to. I feel horrible for her husband as well as her parents, but I'm happy for her that now she's in a better more peaceful place.

One of the best ways to find out if someone truly loves you, is to think about if he or she is truly looking out for your best interest; nowadays, love is totally misinterpreted. Look at his actions and what he says and think, "Are those actions and words motivated by him looking out for me, or for his own interests."\nHope this helps, ....from a guy's point of view, by the way.

Good intentions play a huge role. No matter how much you try to manipulate or lie, your true feelings will show not just in the way you talk but in the way you behave. It's better to be honest with good intentions or else there will be repercussions sooner or later. If you have bad intentions with a woman, you shouldn't be with her at all and the relationship will inevitably not be smooth.

It is a phrase that was very popular in the hippie cult days. It was the implication of ownership with out a outward sign of the establishment sanctioned marriage or girl friend. It was meant to be disrespect full of the social norms of the time, not of the individual in reference. It started out as a symbol of rebellion.\n\nIt has outlived its time. I think it is disrespectful to the significant other. I would much rather hear, "This is the love of my life, the Joy of my soul, my safe harbor in the storm," Than "This is my ol' lady"
Yes, it does. Because sometimes drunk, obnoxious men actually have sex and pass on their genes.
I do! Because the Bible says 'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.' (John 3:16) and I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and rose again from the dead, and because of His blood that was shed, my sins are forgiven and I am a new creation and saved! But you need to remember to live right and holy, pleasing God in all your ways.

Half of us would be dead now. Seriously, we'd have been attacked again, and the reason we haven't is not because of good security, security can never be good enough.

Try to give him a chance. There's always hope. Have faith and be patient. As long as you and he are still alive, there's always something good that will happen. Kindness begets kindness.

Make sure if you decide to leave him you are physically strong and financially stable to support yourself and your baby.\n\nAlso, a little prayer and asking of help from the MAN UPSTAIRS won't do any harm. And when you are helped, don't forget to THANK the Universe.

For that to be true he would have to have absolute power. And anyone who thinks he did have absolute power, needs to brush up on their American government.\n\nActually, that is incorrect. A) Republicans do not control the Supreme Court, though they do like to take more than their fair share of power, not matter whose appointees are on the bench. B) Rep. can hardly be called a cohesive unit - just as the democrats cannot. These are individual people, though they share many beliefs, they are not all 100% for touting the party line (which would have to be true for them to have absolute power). An example of this woul be the recent immigration debate, where several Republicans did not join their party majority, but sided with the Dems. I must assume that when you said that is as close as they can come to absolute power, you meant is our form of government. Otherwise, you would be dead wrong.

To expand on the previous answer: the first major league game was April 22, 1876 between the Boston Red Caps and the Philadelphia Athletics. No home run was hit in that game.\n\nThe first home run was hit by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings on May 2, 1876 against the Cincinnati Red Stockings. (Charley Jones of the Red Stockings hit a homer later in the game for the 2nd home run in history.)
I have a very similar situation happening to me in August as well, only i am not as fortunate because my girlfriend is moving across the country, whereby i will not be able to see her nearly as often. My plan consists of keeping the romance alive. I will never bring up any issues, and i will never allow myself or her to go to bed upset/mad. (these are in case there are any problems.) Other things i will do is to visit her as often as i can, talk to her on the phone whenever her schedule will allow me to (i will make time and sacrifice my own schedule just to talk to her) even if it is only to say "hello, i love you, goodbye." I will e-mail her, and send her e-cards, poems that i have written, just little reminders that i love and am thinking of her. I will send her letters randomly, so that she never knows when to expect the next one (allows for some surprise), and i will randomly send gifts and flowers for no reason at all. Sometimes, i will just show up without telling her (surprise again). I have a good many other ideas that i could share, if you would like, but i will leave you with my most important idea to keep it alive: I will trust her completely. I will never allow myself to become jealous or untrusting because she really does not need that; college will be stressful enough without me adding to that burden. I will let her grow as a person, adapt to her, and be her "backbone" in all decisions which she chooses; i will support her and be there for her. This i believe is truly important. Good luck to you, and I hope that things work out for you!

Alzheimer's Disease is a FORM of dementia. There are other types. It's a physical deterioration of the brain--the neurons are in "tangles" and covered with "plaque" (those are the scientific words) which is a geometrical progression downhill--as more neurons die and become tangles, the surrounding neurons can't communicate with any other ones, and they die too.\nIt is not DIRECTLY fatal like cancer is. What happens is, as the person's brain deteriorates, that person forgets how to do more and more essential functions. Eventually AD patients forget how to eat and starve or choke or aspirate their food into their lungs (causing infection and death), or they forget to breathe and just die. In the earlier stages a person can die through carelessness--forgetting to look both ways when crossing the street and getting hit by a car, or leaving a pan on the stove and burning down the house.\nIt's an awful terrible disease. My dad has it.

I have had so many cashiering jobs... it isn't funny..Ive lost count..But at my last job i was working at a large grocery store...when i ask people how they are..and stuff like that i genuinely mean it!..i had one lady tell me that her cat had just died and that also a few family members had also recently passed..she started to cry..i hugged her and try to console her..i did make her feel a little better...\nanother time a mother and her young daughter (1 yr old) came through my line..the little girl had a big black and blue mark on her forehead..i said to the little girl."oh did you get a boo boo on your head, ouch..boo boo" the mom started crying....saying that it was her fault..because she had left the room for a minute -not knowing her daughter was ready to try to climb up a few stairs- the little one fell down an bumped her head..i told her -from experience-that you can not watch your child every minute of the day..it impossible..and that it wasn't her fault..accidents happen..and this was only first of many..she thought that she was a horrible mother..As i hugged her, i reassured her that she wasn't..she was a good mom..i said look at your daughter..she isn't crying about it anymore..she already forgot what happened...now you know that she is a little dare devil and you will be prepared a little better for the next boo boo\n\nI hate it when cashiers are rude and dont even acknowlede you!!!!there should be some sort of politeness and manners class..for all people that work with the general public..even the managers..they are just as rude!!\n\nI think i should win the "best customer service person of all time" award!!!!! yup yup :}
Because it is separating, there is two main parts to milk, the fat and the milk/water. When you boil the milk the fat rises to the top separating itself from the thiner milk liquid....and then it curdles, so don't eat it too much like that....and use whipping cream instead of milk, it holds much longer, and if your using a cream or a milk base, remember (if it's a soup or a sauce of some sort) to add a little bit of strach, i.e. corn starch or flour, in order to hold it all together, this is called a rue.

Just because the two of you have broken things off, doesn't mean that your feelings will automatically shut off the moment things end. As long as you are honest with yourself then you can deal with your feelings, if you know there's no chance of getting back together then take some time out for you and then move on to someone else because time does heal all wounds, and when you meet someone else you can create new memories. Good luck

The thought of light being simple and obvious either means a very limited knowledge or a great genius who has outsmarted the world's greatest scientists of all time. My first notion would be that if light seems simple and obvious, you have jumped to conclusions; however, I will admit that many of life's great problems come from seeing simple things and making them more complex. However problems also frequently arise from making complex things into simple things that ignore and leave out all the wonderful properties that can acutally be useful. Light behaves in many strange ways: diffraction, refraction, scattering, x-rays, lasers, spectroscopy, wave mechanics, relativity, etc., all depend on our understanding of the nature of light. If you have truly found a way to simplify light so that it is easy to understand without making false assumptions, you should push for publication.
Why don't you just stay there and make the best out of it? Everything can't be so easy, sometimes U have to make sacrifices and face some real challenges, this is what makes us strong. And I am sure it's not going to be any better in public school, trust me. U just have to focus and do what u gotta do to get the hell out ASAP.
I don't actually know you or your circumstances so it's impossible for me to answer with anything that would likely prove helpful to you. It sounds like a lot of this is self-perception. You seem really down on yourself, and that's never good. So the first thing you need to do is stop beating yourself up. Try being your best friend and promoter, for a start, ok?\n\nAre you shy around other people? You sound like you're probably an introvert and that's A-OK. But it does make it harder to open up with people and make friends. So you'll need to work on this too. Here's a tip: Confidence is very attractive to people. I'm not talking about arrogance or being aloof. I'm talking about projecting a positive self-image, which you do as much with your body language as spoken language. Look people in the eye and don't be afraid to express yourself. \n\nThere is no easy fix to what you're describing, though my sense is that you're feeling particularly down just now. Take it one step at a time and don't trip yourself up with negative thinking, ok? There is only one you on the planet. So treat yourself with more respect and others will too. Good luck...\n\nAnd hold your head high! :)
<Gas solubility> : Henry' s law\n At higher pressures, gases tend to go into solution.\n(e.g. soda pop)\n The solubility of gas is directly proportional to the\npressure.\n\n Henry' s law: Cg = kPg \n(The gas solubility equation )\n\n Cg = solubility of gas (M), k = Henry s law const.\n Pg = partial pressure of the gas\n\nWhere Cg is the molar concentration of the gas in the solution, Pg is the partial pressure of the gas, and k is a solubility constant that is dependent upon the gas and the solvent. As we might predict, k is going to be dependent upon the intermolecular forces between the solvent and the gas.\nThe solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas on the surface of the liquid according to __Henry' s law.__\n\n\n<Solubility of gases in water>\nIt is quite well known that gases are soluble in liquids such as water. The ability of fish to breathe is dependent upon this fact. We bubble air into a fish tank and have water fountains in water purification tanks for the express purpose of improving the effieiency of the solution process. All of our carbonated beverages have their characteristic properties because of the solubility of carbon dioxide in water. We know that a soda left open in a warm room will get flat quickly. All of these observations are dependent upon the solubility of gases in water.

The law under which the Selective Service System operates is the Military Selective Service Act. (Act of June 24, 1948, c. 625, 62 Stat. 604, as amended; 50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.). Selective Service Regulations are contained in Part 1600 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR 1600).\n\nWho must register? according to http://www.sss.gov/must.htm\nAlmost all male U.S. citizens regardless of where they live, and male immigrant aliens residing in the U.S., are required to be registered with Selective Service if they are at least 18 years old but are not yet 26 years old. Men who are 26 years old and older are too old to register. \n\nWhat are the penalties if you do not register? According to http://www.sss.gov/FSbenefits.htm \nRegistration is the law. A man who fails to register may, if prosecuted and convicted, face a fine of up to $250,000 and/or a prison term of up to five years. \n\nEven if not tried, a man who fails to register with Selective Service before turning age 26 may find that some doors are permanently closed.\n\n\nAh, okay I got your drift now. A google search of "step forward selective services" comes up with a number of ways to avoid INDUCTION when registering. See an article here or do a search for yourself: http://www.truthradio.com/volunteer.htm
Actually, it isn't better to leave your computers going 24/7. While it will make your power supply last longer, everything else will wear out faster, and your electric bill will roughly triple. Well, your computer's portion of it will, anyway.\n\nAlso, you're much more likely to need to buy a whole new "rig" sooner if it's left going 24/7, because computer components are sensitive to voltage peaks/spikes, but only while they're running. They will experience 3x the voltage peaks/spikes if they run 24/7.

Super-heating is correct, but you'd also like to know why it's more likely to happen with a microwave vs. hot plate. In addition to having to be above the boiling point, in order for an actual bubble to form, there needs to be a small particle in the water, or imperfection (such as a scratch) on the surface of the cup for the bubble to form around. This is called "nucleation". If you heat water on a hot plate, the water gets hot enough to boil first on the bottom surface, where there are usually lots of microscopic imperfections, and the bubbles form right away. In a microwave, though, the waves ignore the cup and heat the water directly. If the water has been filtered, the temperature can climb significantly above the boiling point away from the surface, but not have any way to boil. Since the cup itself if not being heated, it acts as a heat sink, absorbing heat from the water near the surface. That means the water at the surface can actually be cooler (below the boiling point) than deeper within, where super-heating occurs. The slightest jostle or thermal convection, though, can transport superheated water along the surface, or excite any incipient nucleation points that do exist in the bulk water, causing bubbles to form. Since the water is so hot there, the bubble forms explosively.
Depends on which country you are talking about. Different countries have different solutions.

Azan's original purpose is to let Muslims know that it's pray time.\nLogic says that it can be replaced with any other means, but it has some spiritual value in the hearts of Muslims, so it is still heard till now. It became problem when voices became bad and it isnt an issue whether the Moazen (the man who says the Azan) has bad voice or not. also, too many megaphones ( i m talking about Islamic countries) are calling at the same time in a small area making a big noise because of interference.\ntemples or churches uses indoor loudspeakers, i think.

The Renaissance has no set starting point or place; it happened gradually in different places at different times. Likewise, there is not a definite date or place marking the end of the Middle Ages. The start of the Renaissance is almost universally ascribed to Central Italy, however, especially the city of Florence. The poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) is often considered to be the first writer to embody the spirit of the Renaissance.\n\nCheck this out:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance

In 1960 a meteoroligist named Edward Lorenz was researching into the possibilities of long term weather prediction. He created a basic computer program using mathematical equations which could theoretically predict what the weather might be. One day he wanted to run a particular sequence again, and to save time he started it from the middle of the sequence. After lettin gthe sequence run he returned to find that the sequence had evolved completely different from the original. At first he couldn't comprehend such different results but then realised that he had started the sequence with his recorded results to 3 decimal places, whereas the computer had recorded them to 6 d.p. As this program was theoretically deterministic we would expect a sequence very close to the original, however this tiny difference in initial conditions had given him completely different results.\n\nThis sensitivity to initial conditions became known as The Butterfly Effect. This is because it compares to the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could produce a tiny change in the atmosphere, and trigger a series of changes which could eventually lead to a hurricane on the other side of the world. The Butterfly Effect is a key characteristic to a choatic system.\n\nJohn

Oh, yes, you really got that right: democracy is way more controlling than communism!\n\nEinstein uncovered one of worst aspects of a democratic society: "Did you know the microphones on your home and cell phones can be activated to listen in on you at home?" Oh, my gosh, can you just imagine that?? Yes, definitely worse than communism!\n\nWell, did you know that in communist countries they ACTUALLY did that that - quite a lot of people had their houses bugged with microphones - every word they were saying was being monitored. People could not trust anyone. Not even their families as the informers of the Secret Police were everywhere. The safe way was to keep your mouth shut. This unless you wanted to spend a few nights in interrogation.\n \nInterrogation wasn’t that bad. Those guys only wanted to ask you a few nice questions, just to get to know you better. Yes, they made sure they will leave you with an unforgettable experience. They played with your nerves and, ok, some people who seemed to be strong-natured individuals would often burst out crying, but those of tears of joy! I mean...wouldn’t you be more than happy knowing that you would lose your job and have a bad record? Of course you would, that would happen to you if you were lucky. You could have very well been sent to prison to be “re-educated”.

Paris Reidhead\n1919-1992\n\n Paris Reidhead devoted his life to communicating the message of the Gospel in America and throughout the world. A student pastor in the rural Minnesota at age eighteen, Mr. Reidhead felt led of the Lord to overseas mission work. In 1945, Paris Reidhead and Marjorie, his wife of two years, traveled under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission to the Sudan-Ethiopia Border where they surveyed and analyzed tribal languages in preparation for evangelism and education in this area.\n\n Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Reidhead was appointed Deputation Secretary of the Sudan Interior Mission in the Southeastern United States. He was soon a nationally recognized spokesman for missions.\n\n In 1953 Mr. Reidhead began his national Bible Conference ministry for the Christian and Missionary Alliance which brought him, in 1956, to pastorate of the Gospel Tabernacle, the New York City church where the C & M A was first established by Dr. A. B. Simpson in 1887. While in New York, Mr. Reidhead drew on informational resources at the United Nations to pioneer a program through which government and private funds were used for economic development in the Third World; his efforts to implement local programs on this model took him to mission fields in Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\n Third World development became his full-time commitment in 1966. Mr. Reidhead's vision of public-private funding for economic development led, in 1971, to the formation of the Institute for International Development, Inc. which has served as the model for about ninety evangelical organizations which have, in turn, channeled more than 100 million dollars into Third World development. In 1984, Mr. Reidhead founded Enterprise Development International, a service agency devoted to aiding Third World church and evangelical agencies in creating job opportunities for destitute families.\n\n Since Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, and a dedicated Board. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world

Depending on the nature of the business, the entire advantage likely lies in the information the business has. Information about the product, information about the industry, information about the customer.\n\nInformation really is what determines the success or failure of a company. With that, it's clear why the information needs to be protected. As it is currently there is no "perfect" protection. All two-way encryption methods can be deciphered, however some much more easily than others.\n\nBottom line, the better the encryption, the less likely you are to have your information discovered and (in the worst case) used against you.

Option # 6: The big lie. Bush and Cheney had made their plan for Iraq before 9/11. They were not concerned about any of the smoke they have blown about Iraq and Saddam.

there are so many. This most important of which is the belief in one God, who has no partners,children, and parents. \nThe second is that Muhammed (peace be upon him) is the last and final prophet of God.\nThe Quraan- our holy book- is the word of God, revealed to the prophet Muhammed (pbuh). The Quraan has been unchanged from the time of revelation and every day 10000s of muslims memorize it regardless of their age or level of faith.\nIn Islam we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him), Moses, Jacob, Aaron, John, and many other prophets that the christians and jews believe in were all prophets of God.\nThe belief in the last day, heaven and hell, ressurection are all central to the Islamic faith.\n\nThere are five pillars in Islam:\nTo believe that there is non worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammed is the messenger of God.\nTo pray five times a day.\nto give charity (2.4% every year of ones wealth every year)\nto peform hajj- pilgrimage- once in a life time for those who can afford to.\n\nwell thats just some of it.\n Alcohol is forbidden in the Islamic faith\nso is the eating of pork.\n\nAnd being a women in Islam is very liberating!!!!!!\nfor 1 a man recieves a bit more inheritance than we do but the fact is with his money he has to oversee all the muslim women who have nothing, his responsibility is the old lady next door, and the bag lady on the street.\na woman can use her money to buy jimmy choo boots no problem there.\nsome of you are as good as racist and your ignorance pertaining to other faiths continue to amaze me. \nIslam does not teach us to kill as the media and some muslims have lead you to believe.\nInfact it is tottally forbidden except for in the an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth case, and in war women,children, the old, the sick, those praying and the innocent cannot be harmed.\nsuicide is forbidden.\ndonot let the ignorant lead you to believe otherwise.

Leo. Congratulations\n\nLeo is the fifth Sign of the Zodiac. These folks are impossible to miss, since they love being center stage. Making an impression is Job One for Leos, and when you consider their personal magnetism, you see the job is quite easy. Leos are an ambitious lot, and their strength of purpose allows them to accomplish a great deal. The fact that these folks are also creative makes their endeavors fun for them and everyone else. It's quite common to see a Leo on stage or in Hollywood, since these folks never shy away from the limelight. They are also supremely talented and have a flair for the dramatic. Warmth and enthusiasm seems to seep from every Leo pore, making these folks a pleasure to be around. They do love pleasure!\n\nIt's the Lion which symbolizes Leos, and the king (or queen) of the jungle is a most appropriate mascot, since these folks consider themselves the rulers of their universe (and the Zodiac at that). Like Lions, Leos tend to be dignified and strong, and it is this sense of their power which allows them to get things done. A Leo on your team is a good thing, since Lions are eager to see their projects through to completion. Putting these folks at the helm is a good thing, too, since the Leo-born are natural leaders. They may ruffle a few feathers along the way, however, since they can also be overbearing and somewhat autocratic. This may be in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign -- Lions are indeed opinionated and set in their ways. That said, they are well organized, idealistic and have a knack for inspiring others.\n\nMost compatible sign: \nGemini Sagittarius, Aries, Libra\n\n\nCheck the link for your compatibility with other signs. Happy Hunting.

Unless this useless New McLabour Government can look after the British - then it ought not to let any more people into the country - I'm sick of seeing my (high) taxes spent on non British folks - ask residents how they feel about old people being denied medicine and half the rest of the world coming in and being treated for free.

You can try, there might be a few smaller colleges out there or state schools. If not, go to the 2 year college, ace all of your classes and then transfer out. Even if you don't get a's in all your classes but do well, there will definitly be a school that will accept you. If you trransfer, no one is going to care about your SAT ever again. And you can always try taking them over again. Rolling admissions can go until March and you can probably talk to your guidance counselor about informing the colleges you have applied to or are going to apply to that you will be taking the test again. I believe the college board is offering another test in December, so you can sign up for that one jst go to their website. If you want to know what colleges you might have a shot at, go to the princetonreview.com they have this neat little thing where you enter in all your stats and then the name of a college and it tells you what kind of chance you have at getting in.
we have to stay there now to finish the mess we started, my honest opinion is that we should have never started it in the first place, but were in over our heads now. We lost over 2,500 soldiers and if we just pull out nothing would have gotten accomplished. its a catch 22 eaither way you go
Education would go a long way on both sides to reduce tensions and explain differences. I don't think it's hatred as much as ignorance on the part of the West- ignorance breeds fear and resistance, not acceptance.
I believe this is largely due to ignorance. They think they can "catch the gay" or that if they hang out with gay people, they will suddenly "turn gay." It also has to do with some religious fanatics and their teachings. Last, but not least, some people are afraid of what they don't understand.

The wave of patriotism that swept the nation after 9/11 was a double-edged sword. If someone who was already leaning toward military service decided to enlist, that may have been the reason. But the ads for the services tend to focus on the "glamour" and not all the truly grunt work that most enlistees endure. For every pilot, there are countless, faceless others. I believe if a more realistic picture were painted, only the truly devoted would sign up, therefore reducing desertion.

As a child I learned my multiplication tables by making up rhymes for them. I started to learn multiplication at 9 years old and by the time I was 10 and half way through 5th grade, I had them mastered. -Six times eight is on the gate, because six times eight is forty-eight-, -Six times nine is such a bore, six times nine is fifty-four-. I found some sites about multiplication rhymes, hope they help!

No one person invented the Internet as we know it today. However, certain major figures contributed major breakthroughs:\n\n(1) Leonard Kleinrock was the first to publish a paper about the idea of packet switching, which is essential to the Internet. He did so in 1961. \n\n(2) J.C.R. Licklider was the first to describe an Internet-like worldwide network of computers, in 1962. He called it the "Galactic Network."\n\n(3) Larry G. Roberts created the first functioning long-distance computer networks in 1965 and designed the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the seed from which the modern Internet grew, in 1966.\n\n(4) Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which moves data on the modern Internet, in 1972 and 1973.\n\n(5) By 1983, TCP was the standard and ARPANET began to resemble the modern Internet in many respects. The ARPANET itself was taken out of commission in 1990. Most restrictions on commercial Internet traffic ended in 1991, with the last limitations removed in 1995. NCSA Mosaic web browser also came out in 1993, the first browser that supported both text and graphics.\n\nFor an excellent article on history and evolution of the Internet, refer to the following links:\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\n\nOn the lighter side, as popularly said, 'Al Gore' invented the internet.

It depends upon the other outstanding bids.\n\nIf it is on the NASDAQ and the bid is 49 and the ask is 49.50 and you offer to buy at 49.25 and you are the only bidder, then you should become the new bid price raising the bid/ask to 49.25 and 49.50. If there are other bids that may not happen.\n\nIf it is on the exchanges, then you are bidding outside the range. You will limit the prices when the current best offer is taken, presuming no one else will make an intervening bid.\n\nMarket makers cannot bid against the street, BUT if there are other outstanding orders, they are not bidding against the street. So they may keep the old if there are outstanding valid prices because your purchase offer is not in the money as the high bid.

The Yellow River has special importance in the origins of the Chinese civilization. It is referred to as "the Mother River" and "the Cradle of the Chinese civilization" by Chinese. Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated from the Yellow River basin areas.\n\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both "China's Pride" (Zhōngguó de Jiāoào) and "China's Sorrow" (Zhōngguó de Tòng). Records indicate that, from 602 BC to present, the river's course made at least 5 major large-scale changes in direction and its levees were breached more than 1,500 times. A major course change that took place in 1194 took over the Huai River drainage system throughout the next 700 years. The mud in the Yellow River literally blocked the mouth of the Huai River and left thousands homeless. The Yellow River adopted its present course in 1897 after the final course change occurred in 1855. Currently, the Yellow River flows through Jinan, capital of the Shandong province and ends in the Bohai Sea.\n\nThe river gets its yellow color mostly from the fine-grained calcareous silts originated from the Loess Plateau which are carried in the flow. Centuries of silt deposition and diking has caused the river to flow above the surrounding farmland, making flooding a critically dangerous problem. Flooding of the Yellow River has caused some of the highest death tolls in world history, with the 1887 Huang He flood killing 900,000-2,000,000 and the 1931 Huang He flood killing 1,000,000-3,700,000. In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-Shek broke the levees holding back the Yellow River in order to stop the advancing Japanese troops. The river at that time flooded a huge area and the floodwaters took some 500,000-900,000 lives.\n\nAnother historic source of devastating floods was the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with their accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.\n\nSometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the Zhuo Liu (濁流), or the "Muddy Flow." The Chinese expression "when the Yellow River flows clear" is similar to the English expression "when hell freezes over."\n\nSome of the known flood defenses used in ancient times were the building of ditches, walls (dams), levees, and rebound channels to route floodwaters around a blockage. The main problem was that the solutions were local and sometimes the dams were too small and weak for the impact. If the river broke down the defenses, it would cause far more damage than if no levees had been built.\n\nCharacteristics of the Yellow River\nThe Yellow River is notable for the amount of silt it carries, amounting to 1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the Loess Plateau. If the river is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea. In modern times, since 1972 when it first went dry, the river has gone dry in its lower reaches, from Jinan to the sea, in most years, in 1997 for 226 days. The low volume of the river is due to increased demands on the river for use in irrigation which has increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river by 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74000 km² of land. Highest volume occurs during the rainy season, from July to October, when 60% of the volume of the river flows. Water for irrigation, on the other hand, is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation several dams have been built, but due to the hi

The HMS Ark Royal was a young aircraft carrier...just three years old. She participated in the hunt for the Admiral Graf Spee and was involved in a number of attacks against French ports. She pursued the Scharnhorst and the Gneisseau. In May 1941 one of her torpedo planes hit the Bismarck and disabled her allowing other ships to close in and see the fabled battleship. \n\nThe Ark Royal operated in the Med a lot in 1941 and on one of these occasions was torpedoed by German submarine U-81. \n\nProgressive flooding choked the boiler uptakes; since she had no diesel backups, all power was lost, including power to the pumps. HMS Legion was ordered to take aboard 1487 officers and crew to transport to Gibraltar. After several hours, already listing heavily while under tow towards Gibraltar, the carrier capsized to starboard and sank on 14 November 1941. Only one crewman was lost during the evacuation of the ship.\n\nThe carrier capsized and sank on November 14, 1941.

I think there are a lot of people who don't actually "believe in" astrology, in the sense of actually planning their life around it...\n\nBut instead, they just find it interesting to see whether something about them was correct or not. Personally, I have seen many things said of me (about past and future) that turned out to be correct. I don't mean fortune-telling... but simple astrology.\n\nI don't claim to understand it, and I certainly don't hold it as my religion or spirituality. However, I do think there may be something to it that we don't quite understand. I think there are a LOT of things going on in the world/universe spiritually that we have not even begun to grasp.\n\nThat said, there are MANY people out there who claim to tell futures, etc etc who prophet (and profit) from this market... and are completely full of BS. But from my understanding, astrology is not related to future-telling in a mystical way. Instead, characteristics of a person and their future are shown through a system that has to do with the placement of heavenly bodies (planets, stars, etc). It's more like reading a very complex grid than anything else.\n\nAnd who's to say that God doesn't have some order to the universe that we just take a while to catch onto? We tend to be a little slow sometimes, you know....

Alton, Illinois is said to be one of the most haunted cities in the world. It was the site of a prison during the Civil War with particularly harsh treatment of prisoners. After the war, the prison stood for a while, then people started taking the stones from the walls and distributed them throughout the town, using them for walls and all sorts of things. It is believed the spirits of those who suffered followed the stones. \n\nProbably the most haunted buildling in the world is the Tower of London, site of hundreds of executions. Ghosts here include animals from a menagerie that was once kept on the grounds, two young princes who were killed there, Queen Anne Boleyn (said to lead a ghostly procession of lords and ladies to her grave), and the Countess of Salisbury -- 70 at the time of her execution, she refused to lay her head on the chopping block and ran, causing the executioner to chase her and hack at her neck until she died. It is said that the countess can be seen re-enacting her death.

Nervous breakdown: What is it?\nWhat is a nervous breakdown? What causes people to have them?\n- Linda / Minnesota\nMayo Clinic psychiatrist Daniel Hall-Flavin, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.\nAnswer\n\nNervous breakdown is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses. It's not a medical term, and it doesn't indicate a specific mental illness. Generally, it describes a person who is severely and persistently emotionally distraught and unable to function at his or her normal level.\n\nOften, when people refer to having a nervous breakdown, they're describing severe depression. Signs and symptoms of severe depression include:\n\n * Agitation or restlessness\n * Difficulty or inability to stop crying\n * Sleeping difficulties\n * Indecision\n\nThe causes of mental illness usually aren't clear. But these factors may play a role:\n\n * Stress\n * Drug and alcohol use\n * Co-existing medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and certain vitamin deficiencies\n * Genetics\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nervous-breakdown/AN00476

Essential Fatty Acids! Look for a supplement with Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with Borage Oil or something similar. Happens alot when people drastically reduce calories. Make sure you still eat 3 meals and at least 1-2 small snacks a day. Also, don't stick with any diet too long that takes certain foods out of your diet. Moderation not starvation is key. Hair loss may be your indication that you are not eating enough. But check with purchasing EFA's anyway. Any drug store, GNC, Wal-Mart should have them.

As far as I know, RA is thought to shorten the lifespan of a person by 10 - 15 years. This is probably due more to the medications you have to take and decreased quality of life and inability to exercise and rest properly that has shortened the lifespan, not the disease itself. \n\nHowever, with some of the newer biologic meds, like Enbrel, I think this may become less of an issue in the future because damage to the joints can be slowed and prevented, leading to a better quality of life, thereby increasing the quantity. (Just my guess... I'm not a doctor, but it seems logical.)\n\nYou can check out http://www.arthritis.org for info on RA, and there is a very helpful discussion board there as well.

Rosacea is a common but often misunderstood condition that is estimated to affect over 45 million people worldwide. It affects fair-skinned people of mostly north-western European descent, and has been nicknamed the 'curse of the Celts' by some in Ireland. It begins as erythema (flushing and redness) on the central face and across the cheeks, nose, or forehead but can also less commonly affect the neck and chest. As rosacea progresses, other symptoms can develop such as semi-permanent erythema, telangiectasia (dilation of superficial blood vessels on the face), red domed papules (small bumps) and pustules, red gritty eyes, burning and stinging sensations, and in some advanced cases, a red lobulated nose (rhinophyma). The disorder can be confused and co-exist with acne vulgaris and/or seborrheic dermatitis. Rosacea affects both sexes, but is almost three times more common in women, and has a peak age of onset between 30 and 60. The presence of rash on the scalp or ears suggests a different or co-exisitng diagnosis, as rosacea is primarily a facial diagnosis.\n\nTreating rosacea varies from patient to patient depending on severity and subtypes. Dermatologists are recommended to take a subtype-directed approach to treating rosacea patients.\n\nTrigger avoidance can help reduce the onset of rosacea but alone will not normally cause remission for all but mild cases. The National Rosacea Society recommends that a diary be kept to help identify and reduce triggers.\n\nIt is important to have a gentle skin cleansing regimen using non-irritating cleansers. Protection from the sun is important and daily use of a sunscreen of at least SPF 15 containing a physical blocker such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide is advised.\n\nOral tetracycline antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) and topical antibiotics such as metronidazole are usually the first line of defence prescribed by doctors to relieve papules, pustules, inflammation and some redness. Oral antibiotics may also help to relieve symptoms of ocular rosacea. If papules and pustules persist, then sometimes isotretinoin can be prescribed. Isotretinoin has many side effects and is normally used to treat severe acne but in low dosages is proven to be effective against papulopustular and phymatous rosacea.\n\nThe treatment of flushing and blushing has been attempted by means of the centrally-acting α-2 agonist clonidine, but there is no evidence whatsoever that this is of any benefit. The same is true of the beta-blockers nadolol and propanolol. If flushing occurs with red wine consumption, then complete avoidance helps. There is no evidence at all that antihistamines are of any benefit in rosacea.\n\nPeople who develop infections of the eyelids must practice frequent eyelid hygiene. Daily scrubbing the eyelids gently with diluted baby shampoo or an over-the-counter eyelid cleaner and applying warm (but not hot) compresses several times a day is recommended.\n\nDermatological vascular laser (single wavelength) or Intense Pulsed Light (broad spectrum) machines offer one of the best treatments for rosacea, in particular the erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxy-hemoglobin which heat up causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70ºC, damaging them, causing them to be absorbed by the body's natural defense mechanism.\n\nCO2 lasers can be used to remove excess tissue caused by phymatous rosacea. CO2 lasers emit a wavelength that is absorbed directly by the skin. The laser beam can be focused into a thin beam and used as a scalpel or defocused and used to vaporise tissue.

The energy transfer is also causing Earth's day to become longer (currently it is increasing by 15 microseconds each year).\n\nTheoretically, the moon's orbit would increase until the Earth's day slows to match the Moon's orbital period. After this point, solar tides will dominate and the Moon will start moving closer to Earth.\n\nBefore this happens, the Sun will become a red giant (5 billion years from now).

Some findings on daycare:\n\n1.

Unfortionatly in every job there will be someone you can not stand. Whether it be your boss or co-workers. I would say that when it is time to leave is when you start getting so stressed out about having to go to work in the morning, that you make yourself sick physically (Like panic attacks) and you think about how you dont want to go to work the next morning when you arte trying to get to sleep. Or when you start to feel your self-worth is nothing, that would be extremes though. They have to be constant feelings though because we all have those days where life just sucks. lol. If you love your job and what you do than. keep it. Dont let one prick get in the way of something you love.

This sounds to me like a classic herpes virus infection. These are very common. Shingles is a form of herpes called herpes zoster but I think you have Herpes simplex. The only way to know for sure is to get checked when you have a fresh outbreak. A doctor can do a Tzanck preparation which is essentially a free test, they just take a sample and look under the microscope after the slide is stained. If you want to get high tech, you can ask for a viral pcr test of a fresh lesion. These are extremely accurate but a bit more expensive. You may be able to go to a free STD clinic for their expertise. Although this is not an STD problem, those doctors are pretty skilled with skin conditons. Good Luck!

The symptoms of German measles can be so slight you miss them entirely.\n\nThe light rash can come and be gone in a couple of hours or less. It doesn't cover your body and may be so light as to be unnoticeable. You may have a few slight cold like symptoms.\n\nYES you can get it after immunisation - its supposed to lessen the symptoms if you are immunised.\n\nA doctor can order a blood test - a rubella titre - to check your level of immunisation. In Australia its a routine test during pregnancy.\n\nThe problem of course is that German measles is known to cause birth defects so if you are pregnant - avoid anyone even suspected of having German measles.\n\nIf you think you have got German measles, had it, or been exposed to it, while pregnant - go to the doctor.
Sure, send it without problems.

An excellent question. I wish I had an answer. My only guess is that conservatives refuse to believe that large corporations completely control all aspects of American Media: GE, Viacom, Time Warner, Gannett, Disney, Fox... None of these are "liberal" entities.\n\nAnyone who claims that NBC, ABC, CNN, etc. display liberal tendencies has been listening to conservative propaganda for far too long. These are huge multibillion dollar conglomerates. Their only position is to remain huge mulitbillion dollar conglomerates.
The owner moved in the cover of the night with the Colts. Indy offered them a better stadium and a way to make more money. So the moving vans pulled up and were loaded late at night. They kept their name because it was theirs to began with. Now with the Baltimore Ravens they had been the Cleveland Browns. Then owner Art Modell a few months after promising that he would never move the team announced late in the season that they were moving to Baltimore. Yeah Baltimore just basically pulled the same move of building a better stadium. Modell couldn't get a better one in Cleveland and was enticed to move to Baltimore, who had been without a team since the Colts left. The city of Cleveland SUED to keep the name and history of the "Browns." That is why they kept the name and Baltimore didn't. As to the Cleveland Browns the NFL decided to expand again a few years later to add Cleveland again. As to why no team was moved in instead, simple Commissioner Tagliabue was against further moving of teams after Cleveland was moved to Baltimore. Remember that was shortly after both teams moved out of L.A.(Raiders to Oakland and Rams to St. Louis) as well ant the Oilers left Houstan(now the Titans.)

Same thing happened to me a few years back, turns out my right hand was sleeping around on me while I was asleep. I didn't understand it, I thought we had such a good relationship, sometimes, i'd even bring my girlfriends around, and we would have a threesome. \nAnyway, to make a long story short, my right hand gave me herpes, and I had to break up with him. Lefty treats me much better (from what I know, i'm gullable sometimes), and Righty will never know what he could have had!!
No I do not. John Kerry is an idiot and his wife is an even bigger idiot. Someone has to be the fall guy right now. Why not let it be Bush, right? Everyone is running out buying Bill Clinton books and laughing at his jokes. Bill's the one laughing. No one seems to remember that he was the guy in office during the 9/11 planning, but he was too busy getting serviced by the interns in the Oval office to care about National Security. But luckily for Bill, no one remembers that. People just remember who was in office when it happened - Bush - and he's to blame for the downfall from there. So, no, let's not pretend another Democrat is in office.

The one about the guy who goes motorhoming with his wife. She goes to bed early one night and he sits beside the beautiful lake they are ptiched at, getting slowly drunk and comtemplating the beauty of his surroundings. \nHe staggers off to bed deciding he will get up at dawn and swin naked in the lake to cure his hangover. He strips off and passes out, he wakes with a jolt the next morning and dives out of the van naked and ready to swim, slowly it dawns on him he is in a busy high street with people all around. The motorhome has stopped at a red light and that is what the jolt was. His wife packed up early knowing he was p*ssed and began the drive home leaving him to sleep off the booze.

Polyethylene (PE) and Teflon (PTFE) are very different plastics, with very different physical properties. Also, there are many varieties of both polymers depending on the molecular weight. Higher weight generally equals better mechanical properties. If you're looking for something with good wear and thermal resistance - that's PTFE. On the other hand, PE tends to be more tough. PE is a lot cheaper too.
it depends on the man and how fast he grew early on in life. They say anywhere between 18-21 a young man grows to his potential. It's tough to say though, because they say 21 is the age where women top their height.

History\n Original sign with seal from the CIA's first building on E Street in Washington, DCThe Central Intelligence Agency was created in 1947 with the National Security Act of 1947 signed by President Harry S. Truman, and is the descendant of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of World War II, which was dissolved in October 1945. In 1944, William J. Donovan (a.k.a. Wild Bill Donovan), the OSS's creator, proposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt creating a new espionage organization directly supervised by the President: "which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies."\n\nDespite strong opposition from the military establishment, the State Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group in January 1946. Later, under the National Security Act of 1947 (effective September 18, 1947), the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency were established. Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter was appointed as the first Director of Central Intelligence.\n\nIn the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, many disposed Nazi operational agents were recruited as U.S. secret agents; they were induced financially and promised exemption from criminal prosecution and trial for war crimes committed during World War II, their recruitment was under aegis of Operation Paperclip.\n\nThe now declassified National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects, June 18, 1948 (NSC 10/2) provided the operating instructions for the CIA:\n\n Plan and conduct covert operations which are conducted or sponsored by this government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorised persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them. Covert action shall include any covert activities related to: propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.[2] \n\nIn 1949, the Central Intelligence Agency Act (a.k.a. Public Law 110) was passed, permitting the agency's using confidential, fiscal, and administrative procedures, and exempting it from most of the usual limitations on the use of federal funds. The act also exempted the CIA from having to disclose its "organization, functions, officials, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed." It also created the program "PL-110", to handle defectors and other "essential aliens" who fall outside normal immigration procedures, as well as giving those persons cover stories and economic support.[3] By 1949, the West German intelligence agency Bundesnachrichtendienst, under Reinhard Gehlen, was under the CIA's control.\n\nIn 1950, the CIA organized the Pacific Corporation, the first of many CIA private enterprises. Director Hillenkoetter approved Project BLUEBIRD, the CIA's first structured, behavioral control program. In 1951, the Columbia Broadcasting System began co-operating with the CIA; President Truman created the Office of Current Intelligence; Project BLUEBIRD was renamed Project ARTICHOKE.\n\nDuring the first years of its existence, other branches of government did not exercise much control over the Central Intelligence Agency; justified by the desire to match and defeat KGB actions throughout the globe, a task many believed could be accomplished

In my opinion you could do something in power point with some of the most public news and try to find the same news in different newspapers and how does the media change ther version according to the side they support (for example a newspaper that agrees with the republicans and other that agrees with the democrats). A graphical example it would be in 1982 there was a war between The UK and Argentina, and there were different versions, here the media said that wew were winnig, when the reality was that the UK was... that is the best that i can give you.

The most common cause for this issue is you've logged on another computer. When you log in from different computer, Yahoo! will disconnect the session from your first computer... then once you've connected, your first computer attempts to re-connect to Yahoo which will cause you to disconnect. \n\nTo solve this problem, simply Log Out/Log Off from your Yahoo when you've finished using a computer.\n\nAnother possible cause is someone KNOWS your Yahoo!

We know some intriguing details about Christ - that He once was man (or like man, though Only Begotten Son of God), that He was divine, that He died and resurrected and sits on His throne with the Father, with whom He is one. One can speculate on analogies between Christ and the Father, but we know essentially nothing about the "history" of God the Father except that He is eternal. Lorenzo Snow, a President of the Church, once said "As man now is, God once was: as God now is, man may be." This controversial passage is clearly applicable to Christ, a God who became mortal for a time and yet was still and is still God. His work made it possible for us to become as He is, in a limited sense, for we can receive glorious resurrected bodies (Phil. 3:21; 1 Cor. 15:40-45), we can become "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:14-18), we can "put on the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4-10), and we can become "like him" (1 John 3:2). Indeed, Christ even went so far at to say, "Ye are gods" (John 10:34), in reference to the divine potential of human beings. While He and the Father are the one true God, whom we will always worship, He does want us to become more like the Father (Matt. 5:48) and that possibility is there because of Christ. Thus, thinking of Christ and our relationship to Him, what Lorenzo Snow said is accurate. However, it appears that Lorenzo Snow's quote also applies to the Father, indicating that He also experienced a period of mortality, but we know nothing specific. But before you let the idea of "God once being like man" offend you, remember that it is explicitly true about Christ Himself. If Christ were the same being as God the Father, then it would also be true of the Father as well, so non-LDS critics who accept the doctrine of the Trinity shouldn't get so upset. Of course, we believe that God and Christ are separate individuals, one in purpose, heart, and mind. But, in the spirit of pure speculation, let me ask if it is possible that Christ, during His mission on the earth, was doing that which He had seen the Father do? In John 5:19, Christ said "The Son can do nothing, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." Some people have speculated on what is meant by John 5:19 and on what Lorenzo Snow meant, but we do not know and I get very nervous when people pretend they know. Certainly there are many difficult and foolish questions which can be asked in this arena. The important point is that God, Christ, and man are of the same "species," and that man has divine potential to become more like Christ and the Father (e.g., see Romans 8:14-18; 2 Peter 1:4-10; 1 John 3:2). This concept was understood by the early Christians, as I show at "http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_theosis.shtml". \n\nKnowing who Christ is makes me very suspicious of anyone who says that we will become EXACTLY like Him. The Bible teaches that we can become "joint heirs" (Rom. 8:14-18) and can become "like him" (I John 3:2) and indeed, need to become like him (Matt. 5:48) and be one with him (John 17:21-23). Stronger still, Paul in Philippians 2: 5-7 seems to urge us to pursue that goal, not through puffery, but through humble service: \n\n"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: \nWho, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: \nBut made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...." \nHowever, I sense a world of difference between the "small g" gods that Christ mentioned (John 10:34) in speaking of the potential of humans (my view) and God the Eternal Father, who is the one and only everlasting God (see also I Cor. 8:5,6). The reference to humans as potential "gods" is clearly meant in a limited sense, but the word God uses nevertheless is "gods." Obviously,

I had a bad childhood too, but I learned to make good things of it. I will tell you...we sometimes need to think of ourselves and our well being. We need to learn to do things for ourselves and to make ourselves feel good. It is healthy and it is good for us.\n\nYeah, we should think of others and help others out, but you are important as well. Sometimes you have to Take care of your needs and problems first and then worry about the needs and problems of others. Sometimes...when we help others, it helps us as well.

It all depends on where you get your material. Remember to call and have all your under ground pipes and wires marked. To get a round shape I used a piece of PVC, it was probably 3' diameter, that I got from a farmer that used it to supply water to his fields. I just dug the hole a bit bigger than the PVC and filled with concrete in between the ground and the PVC. I Then Put a brick they sell at Wal-Mart around the top edge before it dried. It looks like its all brick. I stacked them about 3 bricks high and used the concrete as a mortar. Then about a week later when it was all dry I mixed up some more concrete and put some in the bottom (removed the PVC first) and let it set. About a week later we used it. And we used it a lot. We also had expanded metal Cut to the size of the pit so it can double as a grill. Just remember to have handles welded on if you do this. This is so when you need to add wood you can remove the metal with gloves. Smores + fire pit + beer = a good time. I bet you could get something similar to the PVC I used, like maybe culvert. You could also just do it with all brick. I hope this helps. Good luck. And remember to get it how you want it the first time. I ended up digging up the one I described to build a bigger one. And the second time around it was pricey. To buy all new materials it could vary in price depending on how you choose to do it.

You ask big questions, and lots of em!\n\nI'd like to first say that the disagreement is about whether God exists or not. There are different terms regarding peoples' views on the existence of God:\n\nTheist - a person who BELIEVES in a god or gods\nAtheist - a person who does not believe in a god or gods\n\nAgnostic - a person who does not KNOW if there is a god or gods\nGnostic - an old term for an ancient religion of people who claimed to have a special way of knowing god.\n\nWhen viewed objectively every person is agnostic. That is, every person is the same - no person KNOWS whether there is a god or not. Of course, many theists think that they KNOW god is real, but actually it is just a very strong belief that they have, not knowledge.\n\nThe entire argument here is really between theists and atheists - people who believe in god(s) and people who don't believe in god(s). Since no one is able to know with certainty whether there is a god or not, all people are in fact agnostic (that is, they do not KNOW whether there is a god or not), although very few admit it.\n\nAll people are actually agnostic. Some people are atheist. Most people are theist. It's an interesting question: why do most people believe in something that no one knows? When you think about aliens (ETs or UFOs) most people don't believe in them, at least not fervently. Maybe a few "oddballs" do, but they are generally dismissed for believing fervently in something that they just have no way of knowing. Not so with religion, and god(s).\n\nSo the question is: what evidence is there to support a belief in god(s)? And more to the point, why do people believe, and often believe fervently, in god(s) when the available "evidence" is:\nA) insufficient\nB) often contradicted by science\nC) often logically unsound\n\nHere are some answers to some of your questions:\n\nQUESTION ONE\n"My opinion on the subject is how can God exist if theres no physical proof he ever existed?"\nWell, perhaps we just don't have the technology to detect his existence, perhaps things do exist that we have yet to detect. Atoms have always existed, but until we had sophisticated microscopes we did not know it, and could not prove it, but some people did theorize that they existed.\n\nQUESTION TWO\n"Secondly, why are there different religions if theres 1 god, supposedly."\nWhy are there different countries? Well, the answer is geography, people are separated from other people, people in certain areas become one country, people in another area become another country. Likewise, if there is a god who "reveals himself" to people in one country, they may have different stories to tell than a god who reveals himself in some other far away country, but it could be the same god! \n\n\nQUESTION THREE\n"Third, why do people who are strong "believers" always try to force you and push you to convert to there religion?"\n\nThat is a good question, which is connected to why most people are theists and also connected to why a large number of people are fervent believers despite the lack of evidence. This could take a long time to give a thorough answer.\n\nThe primary reason that believers push their beliefs on others is because they are insecure. Another word for insecurity is fear. They are afraid of the world around them, and wish to control it as much as they can, in order to make themselves feel more secure. Actually the primary reason people believe in religions (or why they believe the beliefs they push on others) is their fear, too, and the same fear that causes them to believe what they do causes them to push their beliefs on others. People are afraid of mortality - they don't like (and very much fear) the idea that they will cease to exist, so they create complicated stories (mythologies,religions) that if they believe in it, assures them that they won't actually cease to exist -
There should be a number on the back of the cards that you can call and find out the balance. YOu should check them because though these are gift cards, if you don't use them by a certain period of time you actually can lose money on them.

a number of reasons..\nbecause the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night parties\nbecause guys are "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily \nbecause the media portrays "a good time" for young people as" having sex"\nand uncool to go without it \nbecause girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for\nbecause the "safety antena" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim\n\nthus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. \nso girls need to take care, be aware of your own safety dont give "strange" guys the upperhand if you dont want to be date raped..

Jesus said render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is Gods,\nat that time a picture of Caesar was on the money, to day a picture of a president is on the money,\nis it really that important that in god we trust is on money? even if they took it off there would still be a lot of money in circulation with in god we trust on it.\ndoesn't it seem silly that the words in god we trust can upset so many people? are they afraid that if they see the phrase in god we trust, too many time that they will actually start to trust in god?

yes, and yes.\nof course, I had all 4 out at once and they were severely impacted, so that probably had a great deal to do with the pain... but my face swelled up like a chipmunk and it was an entire week before I could eat *anything* non-liquid. I'd suggest (just in case) that you're smarter than I was and don't have this done right before a big eating holiday (Easter's coming up...) I did it 3 days before Thanksgiving and had to have my turkey dinner ground up like babyfood so I could join in the festivities. ewww

I am very serious about my religion. I actively participate in worship every day and I try to live my life according to Pagan family values and morality and I teach my children to do so as well. I am an active part of the Pagan community and I volunteer and donate as often as I am able. I make purchases and develop habits that allow me to walk softly on the Earth, minimizing pollution, etc. I only eat natural food and I stay away from all addictive substances, because my body is a sacred vessel. Every morning I get up and greet the Goddess of Dawn and thank Her for a new day. Every time I sit down to eat, I thank the Earth for providing for me, and I thank my ancestors for setting into motion the processes that brought my food to the grocery store so I don't have to bust my hump to get it lilke they did. Every night before I go to bed, I look up at the moon (assuming there is one) and tell Her all of the things that happened that day that I am grateful for. Every full moon, I gather with my friends to worship, and every new moon we gather to journey. Every solstice and equinox and on the cross-quarter days we gather for a BIG feast and bring offerings for our Gods and have special rituals. Very serious.\n\nPaganism can't be destroyed. Paganism is just a name for something that didn't have a name before Christianity came and became it's opposite, thus requiring us to name it. There are Pagans all over the world and have been since the dawn of humankind. Some of them, though unfortunately fewer all the time, have never heard of Christianity.\n\nPaganism is Natural, this is why it can't be destroyed. It's inherent. Left to our own devices, we'd all be Pagan. When you look around at Nature, really look at it, you are awed and know it is holy. You know that there can't be just what you see, because it's just so wonderful, and you know that there can't be just one type of deity, or spirit because there are so many different types of humans and living things. Paganism also doesn't require that you reject other Gods, either. That's why Christianity was easily accepted, but it didn't mean that Paganism disappeared. It just meant that Christianity was incorporated into it. All we're doing now is purifying our faith, as the Christians have done, purging the Pagan elements, we are purging the Christian elements. And we claimed for ourselves a name.
This wouldn't be a great place to ask for this kind of business. It's a start, but not focused enough.\n\nIf you don't want to place ads in the local newspaper, consider putting together a simple Google Adwords ad and create a simple web page (don't be frightened by the notion, it's really quite easy). \n\nAnyway, you place a Google Adwords ad that will display whenever anyone searches for the words, "Memphis, janitor, office clean", etc and that ad will display in the right hand section of google results. You'll pay as little as .05 per click for people to see your ad. The results will be VERY focused and you WILL get people calling. It's super cheap. \n\nGo here to see how it's done...\nhttp://www.google.com/adwords\n\n... and you can employ some pimply nosed kid to create the web site for you.

Eat less salty foods.\nDrink 8 glasses of water daily to avoid fluid retention.\nRemain physically active to burn calories. Different activities burn different number of calories. Choose an activity suitable for you.\nDo cardiovascular exercise (for at least twenty minutes, five times a week) like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling, tennis, basketball, etc. You can also use a fitness ball. Remain in the target heart rate zone of the exercise intensity.\nWalking briskly for at least thirty minutes puts all of the abdominal muscles to work.\nAdd more mass to your muscles. Concentrate on all the muscle groups. Work down from the largest to the smallest muscles. Concentrate on these muscles in order: front and back of thighs, buttocks, back, chest, triceps, biceps, calves, hips, forearms and shoulders. Exercises with fitness ball or gym ball can be used for all the muscle groups.\nStabilize your blood sugar by eating every 2-3 hours. Know about glycemic index of foods and eat vegetables, fruits, nuts, berries, and whole grains with low glycemic index and low glycemic load values.

Don't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on. I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!

Dreams are ways for our unconscious mind to sort things out. I remember reading once many years ago that most of our dreams are incomprehensible to our waking minds and that we only remember the ones that make some sense to us.\n\nAs for having and remembering weird dreams, you are probably waking during dream sequences and so these strange images are sticking in your conscious memory.

That is a relative question. You could say the US, but then the problem is the widening gap between rich and middle class. You could say Germany, but the high cost of labor is causing industry to move to Eastern Europe. You could say Britian, but the govenment funds pubilc enterpirse that directly competes with private enterprise. You could say China, but there is likely large scale corruption. You could say Cuba, but the lack of private property means that government could intervene when they feel threatening. You could also go with Japan, but there is fear in thinking "outside the box."\n\nPersonally, I would go with Germany, despite the high labor costs. Though I don't know much about the Scandinavian countries or Australia.
Well, if you want blueprints, you can always go to your local municipal development services office and ask to se them. They may charge you a few bucks for photocopies but they are essentially public record. They require no identification or clearance to see and all you have to do is know what you are looking at. \n\nI used to work in one of those departments. The blueprints are used to approve construction permits. Since construction permits are official documents approving development work, they are therefore subject to complete public scrutiny at any time. They legally cannot prohibit you from making a copy. \n\nWhen I issued fuel station permits, we had multiple levels of protocols for environmental impact, groundwater protection, surface water runoff, explosion prevention, hazardous materials, fire, etc... Each of these areas were checked off and cleared by municipal authorities. While Shell may have standards that they follow, they ultimately must get approval from the local government to build and this approval comes with conformity to either a local, state, or regional standards body. \n\nHope this helps!
That's a very touchy subject for me.\n\nI am currently in the armed forces (Army), i have have seen what you've said to be true, you're a hero until your done then the government turns its back on you and sticks you in a sub rate VA hospital with sub-par care.\n\nIf you want to know the best way to support your neighbor i will give you some hints. \n\n1. Always give him the proper respect and courtesy you would expect, believe me he expects it more (it may sound selfish but he deserves it)\n\n2. Ask him about his war stories, most vets who aren't to torn up or have PTSD will bore you for hours with their war stories. Please just listen, nothing makes a vet feel better than telling old war stories. I promise if you take the time to listen he'll be grateful and you'll be amazed.\n\n3. And if you feel the need above all of that..... volunteer, i work at Walter reed, that's where i drill, as a matter of fact i have a drill this coming weekend. There is nothing more pure than the heart of a volunteer.\n\nHope this helps. :)

First, the Edo period is a huge subject so narrow it down to the main points you are talking about. Depending on the length of the project, each of those points will be your sections or main paragraphs. Label those with nice fat Roman numerals. Then chunk each point down and label them A, B, C...\n\nFor example:\n\nEdo Period Japan\nI. Social Structure\n A. Social Class\n B. Political Structure\nII. Art\n A. Theater\n B. Painting\nIII. Religion\n A. Shinto\n B. Buddhism\n C. Merging of Shinto & Buddhism\n\nConclusion.\n\n\nThis is a rough outline that could be really edited because its way too general and it isn't very apparent how each point/section relates to one another. Good luck with you own.

A woman who worked in the next cubicle over from me was singing with the radio one day. The song was John Mellencamp's "Authority Song" which says, "I fight authority, authority always wins," but she was singing, "I fight with Dorothy and Dorothy always wins."\n\nI told my boss about it, and he admitted that he'd always messed up the old Rick Springfield song "Don't Talk To Strangers." Where it says, "Some sleek, continental dude," he thought it said, "No sleep, but a nap will do."
The genesis of the .410 does not coincide with the heyday of shotgun design, which occurred from circa 1850 to 1870. It wasn't until about 1900 that the cartridge is making its appearance in catalogs and the proof houses of England. No one today knows who invented it. There is a good amount of speculation that the .410 was originally a rifle caliber, the .444 Marlin. This is probably so, due to the rather recent discovery of older "rook rifles" that were originally rifles that were converted to shotgun use.
Yes, I was found to have sleep apnea and am now using a c-pap machine..they put electrodes all over your head and things on your eyes and fingers etc..and watch you via camera while yu sleep recording everything...it's not that bad but is a little..I found I was getting almost no stage 3 or 4 or Rem sleep --all restorative..just light surfacy sleep.\n\n.I still think I have problems though and no energy and other related symptoms of sleep apnea almost 30 years. Go for it especially if you snore..have someone observe you to see if you snore r kick in your sleep.

From the reference attached, 1 m^3 will lift 1 kg. \n\nso 100/2.2 m^3 are necessary to lift 1kg, more or less\n\nHowever, it is better to figure it out carefully.\n\nD=density of air at sea level, temperature T\nDHe=density of helium at sea level, temperature T\n\nBuoyant force of helium of volume V is equal to weight of air displaced (Archimedes), so \nB=D*V*g\nwhere g is acceleration of gravity. \nWeight of helium of volume V is DHe*V*g\n\nWeight to be lifted is W\n\nSo to balance these, \n\nB=DHe*V*g+W\nor \nD*V*g=DHe*V*g+W\n\nand V*(D-DHe)*g=W\nso V=W/[g*(D-DHe)]\n\nJust substitute for W, g, D, DHe and you have your answer.

Cautiously O... is right. England turned protestent because the catholic church refused to allow the king to divorce his wife. once breaking an engangment used to be ground of lawsuit. divorce can be considered grounds 4 suit on breich of legally witnessed verbal contract or agreement. but it is accepted that when marrying one knows on what grounds other person can cancle this contract.
I am not sure what you mean by preparation. Basically lipids (fatty acids) are cleaved to produce long carbon chains which are then broken down (via lipolysis not via glycolysis). Proteins are broken down via proteases and enter the cell as free amino acids or small peptides, which can be converted to energy.\n\nProteins and lipids can be converted to glucose (which is broken down via glycolysis) via gluconeogenesis, but they first have to be broken down.
It's very different from school to school, I'd suggest talking to your guidance counselor and parents about why and if you should skip a grade. Skipping a grade isn't just about you being smart, you also need to be able to make up all of that work and knowledge that you're going to miss. Especially in subjects like Math, where you constantly build on previous knowledge, skipping grades can be a fairly bad idea.\n\nIf, after careful thought, you still want to go through with it, then the only way would be through asking someone in your administration, probably a guidance counselor or a dean perhaps. Usually they don't allow people to skip grades unless you're below high school, but even if you are at the high school level there is still the possibility of graduating early.
BUSH, all the way!!! I could defend him all day and all night. He's a great president. I defy anyone who complains about him to do better. It is the liberal media that is bad-mouthing him because he happens to have moral values, and ignorant, immoral people are listening and believing this trash without knowing what the facts really are. These "polls" are saying that his ratings are lower than ever, blah, blah, blah, blah, yet, somehow, he managed to get elected TWICE! I've NEVER been polled!!! Ignorant people are believing these "polls" as gospel truth. Oh, please!!! There happen to still be a lot of people left in this country with values, who believe in morality, hard work, supporting themselves and not mooching off the government, etc.

Probably fame and money. I would say many actors have an internal need to be in the spotlight. They crave the attention. Politics allow them to continue doing this. \n\nYou are right, and it is messed up. There are many more knowledgable people that could do a much better job representing the needs of the people. The problem is that the people are too "dumb" to vote for the right candidate. They like the recognizable actors and feel an unverified trust for them. That's why they end up in office. IE. Arnold in CA and the wrestler in Minnesota.

I guess the one thing that comes to mind is when I was doing some work for an elderly lady (no kin to me). I was repairing her bathroom and to do the job properly, I had to buy materials that were not in my budget. I had to sacrifice my time and materials that I would have spent on my house (it needs repairs too) so that the little lady could have a nice bathroom without worrying about it leaking, etc.. Of course, the hug that I got for doing the work and the God given heartwarming that I experienced made it feel like there was really no sacrifice at all. I try to help others all of the time, but I get as much blessing out of it as compared to the relative sacrifice. The little lady never knew that I had to purchase additional materials because she had given me the money (collected at her church) to do the work. Anyway, I guess I'll keep on doing what I need to do as God directs me.

How would you define "better"? Better human beings? More intelligent? I have found many high school drop outs who seem to have a better grasp on life than people with that expensive piece of paper we call a degree. I know I am guilty of this. I've been in college for 8 years and at times, I do some really stupid stuff. My husband, who attended college for 1 year, has a lot of common sense and "real world" knowledge. Whenever I do something really stupid, I get the "How's that higher education working out for you?" line. Watch Good Will Hunting. Bit of an extreme example, but a good one.
Jail? No. Debtors prisons went out way back! \n\nCouple of things you need to be aware of though ... should the home go into foreclosure - that means the lender had to file legal action against you to obtain the right to sell the property. \n\nIf you do a "deed in lieu of foreclosure" you can save yourself a LOT of money. That would be deeding the RE (real estate) to the lender without them having to take you to court to get it. \n\nSometimes a "quit claim deed" is requested of the lender instead. \n\nNow ... if the lender sells the home for a lesser amount that is owed on it, you will owe the defincency balance. The things you mention that you have: a clear home, money in the bank ... etc etc etc. Those things can be attached by the lender. Yes even your home.\n\nTalk to your lender - they have been there before I'm sure. \n\nSee what they suggest.\n\nGood luck.
SEX before marriage is definitely better,because there is no commitment.I would suggest having alot of sex with as many people as possible before you make that BIG commitment.
great question. ticket touting is illegal and yet these firms are asking many. times the face value of a ticket. An average price of an england ticket for example for the first round games are £600 for group c seats , face value £50 c.a. fifa and the various associations of each country do little to stop this and let the real fans from following their teams. please beware, if you do buy tickets off of these sites as i was sent tickets for a different game to the ones we had ordered at euro 2004. I was not allowed to resell these tickets at the game which i would have let go at cost price as i have no desire to make money off of fellow football fans . we also lose lots of seats to corporate firms( SORRY DEVIATED FROM ORIGINAL QUESTION) fifa must stop this and find better ways to distribute tickets to the real fans who pay to watch there clubs and international teams .
A program by definition requires ram/cpu threads. Any program you choose will "slow" down your system and hog resources. I'm assuming you're reffering to the iTunesHelper.exe process that runs while iTunes is not active?\n\nThe great thing about Mac programmers is that they know what they're doing. That process is designed to relinquish ram when it's needed. So while your system is idle, it's ram usage will increase, under load or stress it will drop it's consumption.\n\nSome alternatives to iTunes are WinAmp, though it can be a bit of a resource hog too, Windows Media Player (naturally), those two together might be able to occupy about 80% of itunes function 'out of the box'.\n\nIf you're music Library is large, you'll probably want to stick with iTunes, as it handles a large library better than WMP or WinAmp.

Decide how much you like him. Nobody is beyond redemption, if you think its worth another shot lay down the rules and give him that chance. \n\nPeople make mistakes reading your short paragraph I can see his angst. You have been together for 2 years its a safe bet you had invested romance into things so his proably felt lost about the correct thing to do (believe me it happens a lot!) Without you being close he really did have his cake and eat it too type situation. He had a great on line friend and a girlfriend he saw everyday. Without you being close he had no compelling reason to ruin that by telling you he had a girlfriend. (This is a crappy thing to do but thats human nature people just don't deal with stuff till they have to)\n\nNo way has he had 3 years of lies with you players don't invest like that...no return for them you know? So its a safe bet a good deal of what he has told you is true about him.\n\nI'd suggest letting him work it out without you pressuring him. If he chooses you while your scarce you know its what you share between you that made him choose you.
Let w = price of wheat flour per pound\nLet r = price of rye flour per pound\n\nFirst we have to set up our system of equations.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n\nNow we will use substitution to solve for a variable. \n12w + 15r = 18.30\nSubtract 12w from both sides.\n15r = 18.30 - 12w\nDivide both sides by 15.\nr = 1.22 - .8w\n\nNow we substitute r into the other equation.\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15w + 10 (1.22 - .8w) = 16.75\n15w + 12.2 - 8w = 16.75\n7w + 12.2 = 16.75\n7w = 4.55\nw = .65\n\nNow we substitute w back into one of the equations to get r.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n12(.65) + 15r = 18.3\n7.8 + 15r = 18.3\n15r = 10.5\nr = .7\n\nSo, wheat flour costs $0.65 per pound and rye flour costs $0.70 per pound.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nNow we can check our answer in the other equation.\n\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15(.65) + 10(.7) = 16.75\n9.75 + 7 = 16.75\n16.75 = 16.75\n\nWe are good! :)

State variables must be linearly independent; a state variable cannot be a linear combination of other state variables. The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, n, is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. The minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction.\n\nIn electronic systems, the number of state variables is the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit (capacitors and inductors).

To Calculate the GCD of two numbers recursively, you can use \n1) Euclid's Algorithm:\n \nint gcd(int m, int n) {\n if ((m % n) == 0)\n return n;\n else\n return gcd(n, m % n);\n}\nOR\n2) Dijkstra's Algorithm\nint gcd(int m, int n) {\n if(m == n)\n return m;\n else if (m > n)\n return gcd(m-n, n);\n else\n return gcd(m, n-m);\n}\n OR\n3) BRUTE force guessing\nint tryDivisor(int m, int n, int g) {\n if (((m % g) == 0) && ((n % g) == 0))\n return g;\n else\n return tryDivisor(m, n, g - 1);\n}\nIn this last one, g is a guess. If the guess works, then it returns the guess. Otherwise, it tries a smaller guess.
Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex... sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching.. making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more... so, if this woman made your friend touch her.. or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging... could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.
No,I think it was because he was hard to get along with and didn't move fast enough.

If you have fatty liver, it can be from drinking heavily or drinking massive amounts of soda. Most soda uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar, this leads to fatty buildup in the liver. Children are more prone to this these days because the soda companies switched from regular fructose to high fructose corn syrup. If you suspect you have fatty liver, the non alcoholic type NASH or the alchoholic kind, you should have your liver enzymes checked and have your liver looked at on a sonogram.

A bipolar disorder is also known as a maniac disorder. \n\nThis is a very dangerous phycholigical sickness in which a person can go completely nuts. That person may not only stop caring for their personal needs, but could also become dangerous to themselves,(could committ suicide), or dangerous to others around them,(could kill someone), if early treatment is not provided.\n\nIf you know someone with this disease, you should consult a psychologist immediately before its too late. A person with this disease could lead a normal life with proper medication and regular visit to their psychologist. If treatment is not provided for a long time,then there is also a risk of the patient going nuts forever

This is a complex question with no one simple answer. But it general it comes down to boundaries. For some people, infidelity is a strong boundary that they will not tolerate being violated. It can also shatter trust beyond repair. But other people are willing to give their partner a chance to earn back their trust. Still others stay married for religious or financial reasons, and some have self-esteem issues and don't believe they are worthy of a partner who doesn't cheat on them. There are more possibilities, but these are a few of the common ones.\nDr. Barb Nefer, www.bnlifeskills.com

I'm not positive on specific companies but...\n\nCheck out the Small Business Administration web site -- they're a great resource for the small business owner. I listed a couple of other handy links as well.\n\nTry reading up on the subject -- check out Amazon, your local bookstore or library. \n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million).

Define a loner and In what context? \n\nPlease keep in mind my answers are from lifes experience, I am not a Trained mental health professsional I am just an earthy, sincere mature person who is willing to share my knowledge.\n\nIn youth (say between kindergarten and grade six) being a 'LONER' might be brought on by a home environment where reserve is the norm. Sometime it is a sign of high intelligence in a child, he/she may feel bored or not interested because they are different in intelect to their peers. Then again maybe he/she my just be new in the neighborhood. On the dark side Being a loner has been shown quite often to be an early sign of mental illness or worst yet, physical or emotional child abuse. The reasons can be many and just as varied.\n\nIn the more formative years say 7th grade to 12th grade the hormones are raging all around him/her and all the same reasons above apply plus some new ones such as \n(1.) Religeous upbringing. (2.) Fear of contageous deseases. (3.) Acne. (4.) Lack of self esteem. (5.) Being Bullied, Not accepted by peers. (6) Serious problems at home. These are the years where you are force by life experiences to 'MATURE'. Choices have to be made and quickly, many and heady desisions have to be made (college or not, sex or not, are two examples), this requires 'MORE SPACE' to ebolve and react positively in emotions and actions. In the mature years college and thereafter all these 'factoids' still play an important role in human relations and even more 'factoids' come to light. An example might be a difference in lifes goals or direction of careers.\n \nThe list can go on and on. And to put it bluntly to you specifcally. This is good time for many commitments. But maybe not a very good time for ROMANTIC/EMMOTIONAL COMMITMENTS.

Sex is trust and trust is key to a lasting healthy relationship, it is not about taking only, so give back and let him know you are willing to experience the extra women with him if he is willing to experience the extra man with you. If he agrees then lay the rules down to be sure there will be no jealousy or certain boundraries won't be crossed such a bisexual areas or if they do happen that there will be no judgement on the other or embarassment.

You do have to wait. It is called "wash" rule. Lets say you bought stock at $100 and now sell it at $50. You just got out with $50 loss. Because it was a two way transaction (buy/sell) you can take that loss and use it to push down your income for the year thus avoid paying more taxes. However if you buy the stock back within 30 days, you are no longer allowed to take that loss and use it to offset your income. REason? Many investors have paper losses but you can't use them to offset income. Real losses you can. This rule was designed so the traders/investors don't "fake" losses by basically resetting the cost basis of the stock.\n\nRival\n\nPS. You can buy stock within 30 days after you sell it but you waive your right to use the loss (if you selling at loss not at gain :) ) against your ordinary income.
Arthritis can only develop between joints that move. Arthritis is basically when the cushion between joints is warn away and the bones begin to rub on each other eventually wearing the bone down causing severe pain or discomfort, as the teeth do not move, they can not have arthritis.
does it really matter if they snub you. i get the same treatment when i go to school functions for my son. i am not there to impress anyone, or to make friends, or to jump on the mommmy bandwagon. i am at school to fight for something my son wants, needs, or feels he has a right to. i am not concerned with what other mothers (parents in general)think. i have my own code to live by, and in 10, 15, or 20 years i will only want to know that i did right by my kid... not the PTA moms. in fact, i doubt i'll even know their names.

Drink plenty of water. Add fiber to your diet - prunes, apples, oat bran, and carrots are good. During an attack, peppermint oil extract helps. You can get capsules or pills that are enteric coated. 0.2 millimeter of peppermint oil is recommended. Drinking peppermint tea can also be soothing. Try to asses what foods trigger attacks and avoid them. You can get a supplement called Robert's Formula at health food stores that also may help. Stress can also trigger an attack so do whatever you can to keep your stress at a minimum. Take time for yourself - it will keep you healthier.

Hi, i am a muslim girl and thank you for respecting my religion. you see, in Islam we have the right to choose. Those who cover their whole face probably doesnt want their face to be seen. Mostly they wear this as their desire,but some wear because maybe their family are very strict and demand that they wear it.me, i dont cover my face but i do cover my hair.we cover these specified parts of our body for a reason.our(woman) body parts are consider precious and should not be seen by men,if they do, its a sin to both the woman and also the man.But the main part that should be cover are the whole body except hands,feet,and face.so those who covers face are consider better.men also have to cover their body parts but they are not as strict as the woman.however there are some that doesnt follow these rules.

If your friend has secured a rental lease agreement via fraudulent means, the complex management should take immediate steps to evict him, and there will be no problem for them to obtain an eviction order, regardless if he up to date with rental payments.\n\nI suspect that if there is no legal leaseholder name on the lease, who can personally oppose any action, such as power withholding, the management has no obligation to provide eletrical services.\n\nYour friend may be well advised to pay any outstanding amount owed to the apartment management by him and seek shelter elsewhere under his own identity.

Comets are hard, compact bodies of ice and dust that orbit the sun. Commonly found on eliptical orbits that take anything from a few years to thousands of years to complete. As a comet gets nearer to the sun a tail of gas becomes visible and appears longer nearer the sun.\n\nThe best known is Halley's comet and Hale-Bopp. The latter being clearly visible in the night sky over Britain about 10 years ago. Comet Hale-Bopp is very unusual in that it has two tails instead of the normal one.\n\nComets are remnants of the formation of the universe billions of years ago. Most comets originate in an area of space known as the Oort Cloud.

Requires more thought...\n\nI don't have an easy answer to this question, because I think an agreement about who is who is required.\n\nIn specific contexts, such as when private property may be taken for the public "good," my anwer is no.\n\nIf you are referring to culture clash, I'd like to continue with my usual "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil," because I do not consider myself qualified to judge.
For Hockey we had a bunch of land training. They should be good across all sports:\n\nRunning sideways with crossover motions of the legs alternating which leg was in front. Eyes on the instructor. Reverse direction every time the wistle blows. Laps after too many fall.\n\nRunning through rope squares. Similar to running through tires which is also another good one.\n\nThe eraser relay, where you run pick up something (in 5th grade gym it was a blackboard eraser), run back to the start, put it down, go back for the other 3. \n\nKeep ankles together, jump over stick side to side in quick motions.

The ASVAB is device used by the military to determine where your talents might be best utilized. I personally believe that talent cannot be measured but that's just me. As a former Navy type, I can tell you that after boot camp you will probably be offered the opportunity to try to qualify for consideration for BUDS training. In the early 80's, at NAS Millington A school, you signed up to attend a tryout for BUDS, we marched over to the base swimming pool and were promptly half drowned by a group of very zealous Seals. This is just a preliminary to see if;\n1. You can swim\n2. If you panic\n3. How much heart you have.\n\nIt does not qualify you for anything, other than a second look.\nBUDS candidates are a fairly select group of people, gleened from a much larger school of tadpoles, but even they get thinned out significantly. As a group these guys, contrary to movies, already tend to be highly intelligent though (this is not determined by an ASVAB but by a process) and have an incredible amount of perserverance, guts and determination. The process is designed to weed out those that think like individuals, don't take direction exactly (also what bootcamp does), and can reach into thier gut and find strength when they don't have the steam for more abuse. This is only BUDS, these folks are not neccesarily SEALS, From my point of view, these folks are more than remarkable, my hat is off to them.\n\nIf this is something your looking at doing, the entire military, and the Navy especially (Don't let a jarhead, air force puke, grunt, or a beach comber Coastie tell you different.), is a good life and offers opportunities you can't get anywhere else on the planet. I wish you success in your endeavor.

LEAP SECONDS\nCivil time is occasionally adjusted by one second increments to ensure that the difference between a uniform time scale defined by atomic clocks does not differ from the Earth's rotational time by more than 0.9 seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an atomic time, is the basis for civil time. \nHistorically, the second was defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. In 1956, the International Committee for Weights and Measures, under the authority given it by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954, defined the second in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time. The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The ephemeris second thus defined is \n\nFor more click the source link.
You can only get a prescription from a health-care provider. He or she should ask you health questions, examine you and make sure you are a candidate for the drug and not on meds that interact with it. If you have a valid prescription, there are online pharmacies that can fill your order, but the cost is not less than Costco or the like.\n\nThere is no such thing as "generic" Viagra - it is still under patent with Pfizer. No PDE 5 Inhibitor is avaliable in generic form yet.

America needs more political parties, a true representation of the make up of its people. If all your elected officials are rich white males, that usually hail from greedy, repressed, right winged, red necked , fundamentalist families, whom in most cases hail from the deep south and Midwest then Americas plot can only continue to erode . \nI do not mean to imply that Europeans are much different, after all the apple does not fall to far from the tree. and therefore America will remain the way that it has always been, Racist Warmongering and Ignorant, And as long as the Bush's and Kerry's keep being born with all the money and power , regardless of their mental capacities or moral turpitude then the good citizens of America will have very little choice other than to remain ignorant, afraid, and poor of spirit. and accept whats on offer.\n\nAmericans must get out from in front of their TVs and off their lazy, fat asses and revolt take charge of their own destiny. because "THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED"

HIV/AIDS can but NOT ALWAYS have flu like symptoms for 3 days to two weeks upon contracting it. After that time period, there are none. However, other diseases easily caught when someone's immune system is compromised are a telltale sign. They ususally appear in advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Caposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer, can appear in lesions on the skin. Thrush, or a yeast infection in the mouth can appear (looks like a thick white coating on the toungue). Pneumonia is common. Diarrhea for lengthy stretches is also common. Most people have no symptoms until AIDS develops fully, which is why it's important to get tested often so that HIV can be treated with drugs early.
I fly in my dreams all of the time. It started when I was very young (5) I am now 42. I learned a lot about out of body experiences and astral travel. The Sylvia Brown book is good and also Doreen Virtue "lightworkers" book. It is good to learn about these things so you aren't afraid. I can control my dreams now (lucid dreaming) and it is great. Try keeping a notebook and pen by your bed and jot them down. Do you hear sounds or feel spinning before you take off? These are signs of astral travel. There is much to learn about dreamtime out there. Explore and have fun!

Hemoglobin in the red blood cells comes in several forms. F is 'fetal' and isn't produced after birth. S is the sickle cell type, and so on. A is one of these, and 1c is a subtype of A. There are several names / abbreviations for it; it is also called glycosolated hemoglobin. It reacts with glucose to form a permanent combination. The modification of this form of hemoglobin has no particular affect on oxygen transport and so is without much effect, save as a record of glucose levels. \n\nFurthermore the reaction goes forward at a nearly constant rate, depending on the concentration of blood glucose. Since red blood cells last about 90-120 days in the blood before being recycled, the amount of HbA1c is proportional to the average blood glucose over the last 3 months or so (with some increased weight to the last few weeks in that period). \n\nThe usual value in a non-diabetic is around 5, and in diabetics with good sustained glucose control will be 6 or perhaps 6.5 or less. Values above perhaps 7 are evidence of sustained poor blood glucose control. \n\n\n\nAnother similar test is the "fructosamine" test. Like HabA1c, it measures the results of a relatively constant reaction rate with glucose, but in this case with blood protein (mostly albumin). It is reprocessed much faster than red blood cells; the value reflects average blood glucose over about 2 weeks.

Don't worry about your total score, especially while playing. You should just focus on each shot one at a time and at the end of the round, add em up and see what you got.\n\nThe important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game.\n\nThe one advice I can give you is to allocate at least 50% of your practice time to your short game. Specifically, 100 yards in. This is were you will shave off the most stokes. Improve your short game now, so that when your body matures and your start hitting the ball farther, your scores will begin to improve dramatically.\n\nI would also recommend reading "Golf is not a game of perfect" by Dr. Bob Rotella. This is an awesome book that talks about the psychology of the game and course management.\n\nIf you practice smartly now, it will pay big dividends down the road.\n\nBy the way, I am currently 37 and carry 0.2 USGA handicap index. I started playing when I was 12 and when I was 14, I was playing bogie golf (shooting 45ish for 9 holes and 90ish for 18). I used the practice strategy I mentioned above and when I was approximately 16 or 17, I went from driving the ball from around 240 yards up to 300 yards. During that same time frame, my score dropped from the mid 80s down to the low 70s. This literally happened over the course of a couple months. I went on to play high school and college golf.\n\nAnyway, just have fun, keep a good attitude and enjoy the outdoors. Best of luck,

Government is the ordering of the unwilling by the incompetent for the ungrateful.\n\nActually, the purpose of government is to do that which is socially necssary but which all people cannot or will not do willingly.

Would the majority agree that police should be stopping speeders? Everybody likes to speed.\n\nAnd, of course, government is the legitimator of force. Only with government permission may one adult use physical force against another. And that's the way it should be.

I have visited Xinjiang, fascinating place! I loved it, especially Kashgar.

They never seemed to mix, and I applaud them for it. Regardless of my opinion, or anyone else's opinion, China will never let go of their prized western regions (XJ and TB)! In Xinjiang, too much oil, coal, and international trade with Central Asia. Tibet, too much tourism money.

During a manic episode, you may be abnormally happy, energetic, or irritable for a week or more. You may spend a lot of money, get involved in dangerous activities, and sleep very little. After a manic episode, you may return to normal, but your mood may swing in the opposite direction to feelings of sadness, depression, and hopelessness. When you are depressed, you may have trouble concentrating, remembering, and making decisions; have changes in your eating and sleeping habits; and lose interest in things you once enjoyed.

Yep, I remember...\nWe were sitting in his truck out by a pond in the desert. It was Dec. 23 2004, and he was on Christmas leave from the Navy. We hadn't even starting dating yet (technically, this was the day we use) But had know each other for years. We dated in the past, then he became my best friend. Well, we were both cuddled up on the passenger seat (we were sort of kissing and cuddling at lot since he had been home, but never made anything official until the hour before he said I love you), listening to the radio and about to watch the sun rise. \nHe said, "You know I kind of like you."\nMy reply, "Yes, I know."\nHis response, "Okay, well then, I love you."\nI say, "I know that too."\nHe looks at me, confused and asks, "How do you know that?"\nI replied, "It's been obvious for the past few years."\nHe proposed on Valentine's Day 2005, and we were married July 7, 2005.

No, time is dependant on your frame of reference according to Einstiens theory of relativity. The Twins paradox demonstrates this well. A pair of twins, both born on the same day. One remains on Earth, the other blasts off in a space ship travelling at 70% of the speed of light. The space explorer returns after what appears to be one year in space but upon landing finds that the other twin has long since died of old age, so has all his friends. Time slows down the closer you get to the speed of light. It also slows down the closer you get to large gravity wells like black holes.
A republic is a kind of democracy. Democracy is a wide-reaching term referring to basically any system of government in which the people play a significant part in the running of the government. A pure democracy is one in which every citizen votes on every decision, which is fairly impratical with the size of today's nations. A republic is a representative democracy, meaning people vote for people (president, representative, senator, etc.) to go represent them while actually running the country. This allows people to not spend all of their time voting on every bill, but still gives them control over how it is run, since most elected officials want to be reelected, and also avoid being recalled.

Whew - that's quite a group! \n\nThe B vitamins are important in metabolic (say: meh-tuh-bah-lik) activity - this means that they help make energy and set it free when your body needs it. So the next time you're running to third base, thank those B vitamins. This group of vitamins is also involved in making red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. Every part of your body needs oxygen to work properly, so these B vitamins have a big job. \n\nWhich foods are rich in vitamin B?\n\nwhole grains, such as wheat and oats \nfish and seafood \npoultry and meats \neggs \ndairy products, like milk and yogurt \nleafy green vegetables \nbeans and peas \ncitrus fruits, such as oranges
Actually, very few autographs (original copies) of ANY work older than about 300 years have survived. We have no originals of the works of Aristotle, Homer, Plato, Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, or even Shakespeare. Shakespeare died less than 400 years ago. Yet scholars believe that the copies we have of all these works are accurate to the original. There is NO ancient writting, however, that we are more sure of than the Bible.\n\nThe Old Testament was written between 1500 and 400 BC. The earliest copies we have of the Old Testament date between 200 BC and 200 AD. That means that some of our earliest copies might have been written 1700 years after the fact. This sounds like there is a lot of time to make a lot of errors in copying. If this was any other book, that would probably be true. However, we know a great deal about HOW the Bible was copied. First, we know that copies were not made very often. We have records that tell us that books were only copied once every 300-400 years or so. These copies were done by only the best scribes, and under very strict guidelines. We have obtained checklists that a copy must go through before it can be used. The checklists were along this order..."The 359th word is THE, the 78th letter on the 22nd page is L, the book contains 1294 words, etc." If the copy did not pass all of the checklist items, it was redone. This means that our copies of the Old Testament have probably not been copied more than 8 times, and in some cases, probably only once or twice, under the strictest guidelines imaginable. This is a far cry off from the "telephone game" scenario that critics would like you to believe.\n\nThe New Testament is a bit different. It was not copied under such strict guidelines, and it was copied over and over and over again. We are not so assured of its accuracy based on the methods of copying. However, we are assured of its accuracy because of the great number of manuscripts we have, the relatively short amount of time between these copies and the originals. We have hundreds of manuscripts from the 1st and 2nd centuries, and thousands of manuscripts from the 3rd and 4th centuries. We are able to compare all of these manuscripts to one another and determine where and when certain discrepencies arose. There is only .5% of the New Testament that is of any real dispute, and none of those verses contain matters of doctrine that are not addressed in other areas of the New Testament.
There has never been a book that has out sold the Bible, so wherever you heard that, it is incorrect. As Christians, we use the Bible for many different things, including instructions on living good lives. Good Luck!!!!
I was hesitant about walking also, mainly because I really didn't know any of my peers in my graduating class either. However, I did because there was that whole parental guilt trip thing "We've waited so long to see you graduate!" I also did find out that some colleges, mainly the larger universities, don't even have ceremonies where their graduates walk. All their graduates do is just stand up when their specific school/major is announced. That's pretty lame because you get no recognition whatsoever. So if your ceremony actually will call your name, I don't think it would be so bad to attend.

The most important thing is develop your own beliefs. If you believe in something; study it so that you have a foundation to what you understand, that will leave you less open to manipulation. Most religions are about self improvement not social, so in developing religious beliefs you should be improving yourself which means some study. Most manipulators rely on peoples ignorance not their own knowledge of the truth. \n\nWhile fellowship is important in sharing and asserting what you believe it isn't where you should get your ideas. Study what you believe and think deeply about it. \n\nNever be afraid to question yourself or your beliefs because it leads to understanding.

As to the Jewish question, the only serious contender that quickly comes to mind was Senator Joseph Liebermans' run for the Vice Presidency/Presidency a few years ago. I don't know why there haven't been more contenders through the years. I think this country would elect a Jewish President and I do not think most voters would automatically discount a Jewish contender just because of religion.\n\nOf course John F. Kennedy was our first, and so far our only, Catholic President. His election proved that the American people would elect a Catholic President, and no doubt there will be others elected in the future. The biggest reason that no Catholic was elected President prior to JFK was the fear that a Catholic President might be controlled by the Vatican (Pope). The history of the Catholic Church tends to legitimize this fear to some extent.\n\nThe history of Europe in the last 1500 years is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Catholic Church. The Vatican held a virtual stranglehold over the European continent for many centuries and was the power behind the political institutions of the day. Much harm was done to many people for many many years in the name of religion. Of course religious conflict still exists all over the world.\n\nTwo of the founding principles of the United States were the freedom of religion and the separation of Church and State. These principles were the direct result of the lessons learned from the study of the history of Europe.\n\nThe Christian religion is divided into two basic camps, Catholic and Protestant. While the Protestant religion has fragmented into many sects (Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc.), the Catholic religion has remained centralized with power residing in the Pope and the Vatican. They still wield considerable power throughout the world and this power is still feared by many people. \n\nAs a group, Protestants outnumber Catholics by significant numbers in the United States. This voting block has kept the so called "Catholic menace" at bay for most of our history. Only JFK's skill as a politician enabled him to overcome the obstacles presented by his religion. I think he proved to most people that a President of the United States, who is of the Catholic faith, could lead this nation without being unduly influenced by the Pope or the political arm of the Vatican. I'm sure there will be others to come.\n\nHistory is fascinating to me because I think to know where we are going, we first must know where we have been. I firmly believe in that the old saying, "Those who fail to learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them". The study of history is, in part, a study of those mistakes. Do you see a repetition of the past in the events taking place in the world today?\n\nInteresting questions always make a person think. Thanks for your question.\n\nBest wishes to you and yours.
Yes, they have nukes. If Iran starts something and uses a nuke on Israel, I'm sure israel would respond with one. BUT, the USA, Russia, England and the UN would get heavily involved before it ever came to that.
Yes, you are right. And, it was on Mt. Moriah. This is where the Temple was later built. It was all the same place. The rock Abraham put his son on is the rock in the now present Dome of the Rock.\n\nInteresting question---------and an unusual one! That is nice.
Yes, a mistress is bad. Where is the goodness when one is turning away from their partner and not towards them? You absolutely cannot fix a problem inside a relationship by turning outward. All that does is create problems. \n\nA relationship has to meet the needs of the two people involved. One must understand what one’s partner's needs are so they can meet them. One must figure out what their own needs are and communicate them. So basically, if your needs are not being met, communicate and negotiate. Don't let resentment build.\n\nIf you want to hold hands more, you express that. If you want one night out of the week from the basic traditional sexual up keep, one night of the week to be intimate with your wife in the backseat of your mini-van or on top of the washer machine, you express that. In turn if your wife wants to shave your genital area, you allow her to express that. If she wants you to suck her toes, you allow her to express that and negotiate. \n\nYour relationship must be based on a solid, underlying friendship. Friends talk, laugh, share, and do things they're interested in together. Don't stop being friends just because you're each other's spouse.\n\nAll in all, if you want to have a good partner, be a good partner.\n\npaaatches –You get what you give. When you give better, you get better. And, I don’t think it’s fair, fair to you, fair to your wife, fair to all the parties that are involved. You are intruding upon her turf. On everyone’s turf. You are a trespasser. It is no different than being a thief in the night. It is no different than breaking into their house and stealing their things just so that you can be pleased and feel as though you are number one. And, why you don’t feel as though you are number one all on your own beats me? Perhaps, you should start there? Perhaps you should start seeing you for you and all the factors that make you number one in your own eyes. Perhaps you should ask yourself or figure out for yourself what makes you feel good, what you want, what you enjoy doing instead of sitting down next to someone with vagina and saying, "hey my penis goes in there, feels so good! Okay, me bored, again… can you tell me how wonderful I am again, make me feel number one again because I am bored, I am bored!" Thanks for sharing with us the formula for failure. All hats off to you.

It is an illusion. People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are, but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down. Really! I have tried it. And it is not only the Moon, but trees and buildings too. As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller. I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright. The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs, but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down. Try it, it is easy!
There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria "hispanic women aviation scholarships" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!

Usually normal babies this age can begin eating strained or pureed foods at first. Plain rice could be difficult or dangerous for the baby if it is still firm as he/she could choke on it. It would be best to ask your Doctor for advice pertaining to your baby in case there are some special concerns and for a general nutrition plan. Also, there are many good books and pamphlets about this available from WIC or at your pediatrician's office.
Mr Harvey is a theatrical old man. He used the term "crusade" to incite his listeners to feel a certain predetermined way.\nFrom a historical stand point the Crusades were not about religion, they were about the fears of European rulers. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire threatened my rulers, the only way one could get an army to fight thousands of miles away was to create an agenda and a cause. At that time in our history religion served that purpose...today it is the "fight for democracy".
It is very tightly controlled these days - it used to be that you could neutralize the acids with bases and put them down the drain (not any more).\n\nChemical machining by its nature dissolves large quantities of metals into acids. These days an elaborate system is setup to precipitate all the metals out of solution down to the parts per million level, and then any waste acid that can't be recovered is sent to an incinerator. Nothing is allowed down the drain, and the EPA is watching what comes down the drain very closely - the will sue you if you dispose of any heavy metals down the drain.

Yo-yo dieting is very, very bad for you. Like it was said above, it will slow down your metabolism. When you starve yourself, your body begins to break down what energy stores it has to say alive. Most people think that it is just eating up the stored fat they have and that is why they are losing weight. THAT IS NOT TRUE! \n\nThese trendy diets are all cleverly schemed ways to reduce your calorie intake and what usually happens is that you get so sick of their food that you quit eating all together. This is NOT good. \n\nWhen you starve yourself, your body breaks down the amino acids in your muscle and converts them into the compounds its needs to use glucose as energy. So, you begin to loose weight and you think the diet is working. But the diet is actually killing you. Have you ever found that when you lose that weight your are urinating a lot? That is because your body is getting rid of the Nitrogen that is found in the muscle's amino acids it is breaking down. So your weight is going down, but you aren't losing any fat or getting much smaller. Also, muscle tissue is what drives your metabolism, so if you lose your muscle tissue you are also losing your metabolism. Remember, muscle weighs more than fat.\n\nThe only way to lose weight and not kill yourself is to cut your calories and increase your exercise. Do something you like to do. Run, walk, ride a bike, etc. Eat healthy. \n\nHow to figure out how many calories you need to eat a day:\n\n1- Take your weight and divide it by (2.2). This will give you your weight in kg. Then if you are a girl times it by 22 (guys multiply by 24). This is how many calories your body needs to stay alive (breathing, your heart rate, etc). Now I am guessing that you are a pretty sedentary person. So multiply that number by 1.3. This will give you how many calories you need to stay alive and move around every day. Now take that number and multiply it by 7. This will tell you how many calories you need in a week. Now you can figure out how many calories you need to cut back to lose weight. \n\n2- You should not lose more than 2 lbs per week. If you are losing more than 2 lbs per week, you are probably losing muscle tissue and therefore actually slowing down your metabolism, not helping it. \n\nYou need to eat 3500 calories less than you need to lose 1 lb of fat. So take your total calories needed every week and subtract 3500 from it (7000 if you want to lose 2 lbs). Now divide that number by 7. This will give you how many calories you should eat per day. Now, you should NEVER EAT LESS THAN 1200 CALORIES PER DAY! This is just not healthy. \n\nTips to stay on your diet:\n\nEat a variety of foods, just watch your calories. This way you do not get sick of the diet. Plan your meals with a variety of LOW-CALORIE food.\n\nMake a shopping list, don't shop on an empty diet.\n\nAvoid alcohol. Alcohol is high in calories and low in nutrition.\n\nOnly weigh yourself once a week, in the morning. This way you are not freaking out the next morning when you haven't lost 5 lbs.\n\nKeep a daily record of what, where and how much you eat.\n\nAvoid midnight snacking like the plague. You will still be alive in the morning.\n\nEat slowly. It takes your body 20 minutes to realize it is full. One way to do this is to put down your fork in between bites.\n\nOnly eat in one room of the house. That way your body is not conditioned to eat in the living room, bedroom, etc. You will only get hungry when you go into the kitchen. \n\nPut your dinner on smaller plates so it will look like more food, and when you finish put your plate away so you are not tempted for seconds. \n\nEat regularly, in the same place (nowhere else), and smaller meals. This is so your body uses all the energy you put into and doesn't store any as fat.\n\nGood Luck!

College admissions are about a lot more than test scores; the strength of your personal statement, HS transcript, recommendations, extracurriculars, and personal interview (if you have one) all will play into admissions. Other factors such as your socioeconomic status and race may come into play also.\n\nYour scores specifically will almost certainly not prevent you from getting into college, presuming you apply to a variety of schools, write a good essay, and have reasonably good grades (for example, getting grades in the B range, or better, with only a few C's). At over 2000 colleges listed on the "College Matchmaker" under the student section of collegeboard.com the middle range of students (between the 25th and 75th percentiles) - the 'average' student - has scores on par or below yours. Your scores aren't bad at all - in fact, of all 2006 SAT test takers, your verbal and writing are only about 70 points under average and your math is about 100 points above average! And at that, many schools aren't even yet considering the writing portion of the exam, your lowest score, because it is new. So your scores are not bad at all; they are well within the average. \n\nThis is not to say that you will have to settle for the 'average' college. It is rare, though not unheard of, for someone with your score to get into highly competitive schools, but you will need to be an exceptional candidate in other areas in order to do so. If you have your heart set on a school that is a 'reach' for you based on your scores and/or high school GPA (you can check out the average SAT scores of students at potential schools for you at collegeboard.com) then you probably should take the SATs again if you have time/money, haven't done so already, and think you will improve. \n\nBut either way, don't stress! If you haven't already, get a list of colleges you're ready to apply to - one or two that you definitely will get into (with a majority of students of your profile achieving below what you have achieved in SATs/GPA), one or two reach (with the average student surpassing your scores/grades), and some in the middle. If you have decent grades and put time and thought into the application process, you will find yourself successful.
Bull fighting is a huge part of Spanish society and culture. Rightly or wrongly. The astonishing thing about it is that the rest of the world consider it to be a sport. This amazes the Spanish people. Bull fighting has never been considered a sport in Spain. It is a form of theatre. It is a display of man against beast and is one of the largest audience spectacles in the world. It is classed as "tragic theatre" in much the same way as "Macbeth" by Shakespeare. \n\nThe bulls that are used in the bullfights are specifically bred for that purpose and until their "day of reckoning" they are kept in the lap of luxury and are fed the best of food.....the training grounds are immaculate and the spend their days being pampered and very well looked after. Of course they have their final day in the bullring and we all know the results of that. It is however part of the theatre and part of the culture of Spain.\n\nBy the way, I am not a supporter of bull-fighting but I do know a lot about the history of it.....it is not as simple as killing for killing's sake. The bull will always die, that is the tragedy of the theatre of the bullfight, but the unknown element and the excitement comes from the knowledge that the matador could also die in his efforts to kill the bull...that is what the crowd go for.....the challenge of man against beast...it is part of the old spanish culture.

You really can't do that by yourself.

I've asked my husband, and he was honest. I've gained some weight since I've been stationed here and he said that I have "some chub" I said straight out, no I'm FAT. (10lbs is a lot for someone as small as me. Eventhought no one else in the world will tell me I'm fat. My family and friends all think I'm crazy, but I do have chub on my belly. I'm so glad he's honest) but I think guys should always always be honest. I want him to tell me I'm fat so it'll motivate me to go to the gym more. Or have him tell me to have less unhealthy foods when we eat. It's helpful. It's embarrasing, but don't punish him for your own mistake!\n\nToo many women get so sensitive about being fat, but the truth is, YOU PROBABLY ARE FAT! so don't get mad if someone says you are. The average Amerian is overweight. Being fat is gross. If your man can tell you that you are overweight or say you could do with losing a few pounds, you should love him more for being honest. And stop being so hard on them for being honest! It's not THEIR fault that YOU are fat!
on the whole, what man considers to be "constructive" might be considered by nature to be "destructive". in order to build, something must be changed, or 'destroyed'. it's a philosophical question, probably depending on your personal point of view (man vs. nature)

There is no pay for ball kids. They are volunteers, and some of them are junior tennis players that want to get closer to the athletes.

It comes from a couple of verses in the Bible: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north." (Isaiah 14:12-13).\n\nLater tradition make Lucifer the nom de guerre of the Archangel Sammael. He was followed by a whole army of angels, in his pride feeling he was too beautiful, well-liked and smart to be second to God. Gabriel defeated him in the crucial battle, and exiled to Hell he changed his name one last time to Satan.\n\nBut it all comes from those verses in the OT that were actually condemning the arrogance of the Chaldean King in Babylon.\n\nPS: Lucifer, the "light bearer," is the Hebrew version of what for the Greeks was Prometheus. Humans were like animals, with no intelligence to create moral values. According to most religions, what makes humans radically different from other creatures is their ability to say what is right and what is wrong.\n\nWithout intelligence, right and wrong cannot exist. So Lucifer, or Prometheus, are a symbol for intelligence. Lucifer rebels before God because he feels he is smarter and more beautiful than God, he puts himself above God, and seduces millions. In other words, it is human intelligence what allows us to disobey God, since we can convince ourselves that "right ir wrong and wrong is right."\n\nOf course Lucifer is right. A previous poster is correct: he is the one that, in the mythos, tells humanity to think by ourselves and stop following prescribed rules just because they are said to come from some higher power. \n\nAs George Bernard Shaw put it in his novel "Back to Methusdelah," when the Devil, in the shape of a serpent, approaches Eve, he tells her:\n\n--You see things; and you say, "Why?"\nBut I dream things that never were; and I say, "Why not?\n\nLucifer, hence, stands for our own capacity to think. The reason why we have been conceptually expelled from Nature: we cannot be like the other animals, we never could.

In the "Alternative Health" circles, most will agree that the standard TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) test doesn't cut the mustard! Its the one that most docs do.

Rough sex is wild, energetic sexual intercourse. Bites, scratches, bleeding, and bruising are not an uncommon result. More often sex of this nature involves humiliation, spitting, choking, urinating, slapping or rough analingus.\n\nAlthough rough sex may appear violent, rough sex is not rape or sexual assault. Consent is the prime distinction.

For their sun sign, they are either a Pisces or an Aquarius. I'm guessing that they are born on the cusp, but that still doesn't mean that they are both signs. If that person is a Pisces, then oh my, they are just full of water signs! All of the water signs are represented in each part of their major three placements!\n\nThey are probably going to be extremely emotional with lots of feelings. Inside, they're a water sign. Outside, they're a water sign. Their emotions are that of a water sign. I'm going to include some interpretations, not necessarily of love, but of just how having each of those placements will affect them.\n\nThis is from Bob Marks Astrology:\nMoon in Scorpio: The Moon is emotions and Scorpio is the sign of extremes and jealousy. Any questions? It goes without saying that these emotions have to be channeled into the right direction or there may be a few minor problems. On the positive side, this placement increases the emotional need for great sex.\n\nSun in Pisces: Aquarius is the genius who "knows". Pisces is the mystic who "feels". I call Pisces the most agreeable sign in the Zodiac, because whomever they meet, they agree with. Then they meet someone with the opposite opinion and agree with them too. Afterwards, they go off and do something totally different from either thing that they agreed with. They just don’t want to get into upsetting disagreements. Yes, of course there are many people with a Pisces Sun who will argue, but less than with any other placement. Usually, in those cases, you will find a strong Mars in the horoscope, or Saturn for firmness. Sun in Pisces increases imagination and sensitivity. It inclines to charity and taking care of the poor, sick, and unfortunate. Many of those poor, sick, and unfortunate also have strong Pisces or Neptune placements. Pisces can play both sides of the sympathy fence. More than other placements, it gives a far-away look to the eyes and the ability to just "go off’. It is the only sign that can be alone in a crowded room.\n\nAnd Aquarius Sun, just incase they are an Aquarian sun instead of a Pisces:\n\nSun in Aquarius: The line between genius and madness is thin. Many people with the Sun in Aquarius have erased that line.Think of Carol Channing or Tommy Smothers if you want a picture of what the zany type is like. Ayn Rand and Angela Davis, the Marxist revolutionary, represent the type that is certain they have found the philosophical key to the Universe. Thomas Edison represents the truly revolutionary side of this position. So, in a lesser way, does Charles Lindburgh. Sometimes they see so far ahead that what they talk about seems totally crazy. Years later, they are, more often than not, proved right. Aquarius is the sign of friendship, and Aquarius Sun-Signs are frequently closer to their friends than their families. Jack Lemon once said in an interview, that his son was his "best friend". You could tell by the way he said it that he held "friend" in higher regard than "son".\n\n\nThis is from Astrology-Numerology.com:\nThe Moon rules the sign Cancer, and therefore is called the ruler of your horoscope. When the Moon is so predominate in a chart, it produces a personality that is sensitive and a little on the timid side. You like to feel out a situation before projecting yourself into it. The Moon is the indicator of emotions, the feelings, and the sensitivities. It is also closely related to the mothering instinct. You are very protective of those who are close to you, as you are protective of yourself. If you don't have a family around you to mother, you'll probably exhibit these characteristics with your friends. \n \nBeing extremely receptive, you may be somewhat psychic or at least extremely sensitive to your environment. Your moods are very strong and changeable, much like the tides. You are ruled by your strong emotions and intuition. You can change moods in
You can combine the right side terms using the\n property log(a/b) = log a - log b in reverse.\n\nIt is log(3/(2x-1))\n\nSo now you have log(x+1) = log(3/(2x-1)\n\nSince the logs are equal, so must be the things you took the log of.\nSo x+1 = 3/(2x-1)\n\nCross multiply: (x+1)(2x-1) = 3 \n\n2x^2 + x - 1 = 3\n\n2x^2 + x - 4 = 0\n\nSolve for x. Check that when you plug it in, you don't end up with the log of a negative number.

Metal only needs one thing to rust, oxygen. Water and salt are catalyst, but really it's metal oxidizing. Paint helps prevent rust because it keeps oxygen from making contact with metal.\n\nSo metal will rust more when there is a lot of heat and oxygen (heat speeds the oxidization).

Sorry I don't know of the essay you mention, but I would like to say that whether or not a person could accept that theory would depend entirely on their perception of what "God" is. Personally, I enjoy holding an idea that "God" is the spirit of life, love, intelligence, creativity, etc. that permeates all of life, including not only people, but plants, animals, etc. and since I still see that all of these are here, it is impossible for me to accept any theory that "God" is not here now. Of course, if someone holds "God" to be some kind of "man" (father) in the sky, or somewhere else up there or out there, then accepting another theory than mine might be easier for them. I know in my heart that "God" is always present and active in my life, and in all life......and my genuine respect for life is a sure form of "worship."

Malevolent demonic spirits will always approach you, or speak to you, from the left side of your body (the left ear). Spirits from the Divine Nature (God), being the Holy Spirit and benevolent angels, will always approach you, or speak to you from the right side (the right ear). This is so because the "righteous" stand at the right hand of the Father, and that which is against God stands at the left.\n\nThere is a “test” in the Bible to determine if the spirit is from the Divine Nature or the demonic nature, located in the book of 1 John 4:1-4… “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.”\n\nHence, demand of the demon if it acknowledges that Christ incarnated into flesh, was Crucified and Resurrected. They will deny this, and thus you will know it is a demon.\n\nAs far as eliminating the evil presence, speak to a Christian Deliverer, they are equipped in these matters, but be prepared that it may require that you may have to go through the Rebirth in Christ to secure His security. It may just as well be that God has allowed all of this so that you may know Him.

Bike gears or speeds allow you to pedal more efficienttly. \n\nThe number of speeds your new bike has is the result of your front gears multiplied by the rear one. Newer MTB bikes will range from 21 to 27 (3 on front and 7,8 or 9 on the rear cog) while road bikes will range from 14 - 18 (2 on front 7,8 or 9 on the rear cog)\n\nThe front gears are controled by your left hand shifter (dial/knob) the smaller ring is easier for the hills, while the big ring is better for building speed or going downhill.\n\nThe rear gears are controlled by your right hand and they work the opposite as the ones on front, the bigger cog will be easier going uphill and the smaller cog will be harder.\n\nMost of the time you can ride on the middle ring, while shifting only the rear cogs. As you get the hang of it, start shifting the front rings.\n\nI leave some links that are more technical and will help you enjoy your new bike

Here's an idea: \n\nTry learning how to properly phrase a specific question...so that people have an idea as to what you're talking about.
Junk mails are those which r mostly from online advertising/web marketing sites....\n\nWho sents it and how? Basically they get our Id from some linked sites wherein we have subscribed or smtimes through spywares/spam emails which we open. Mostly they get it from the subscriptions we make when we create an online account in any website/email site. Though mostly used for online marketing...somtimes r used by hackers for malicious activities too....\n\nWhy they go to Bulk folders? Coz bulk folder contains all the mails which are addressed to more than one individual...hence as these mails are meant for online marketing/spamming it contains multiple addresees.\n\nAnd above all Junk is a term what we give to a mail which we found is not useful for us but it may not be junk for somone who is relate to it....\n\nHence it totally depends upon individual perceptions...
I am a professional recruiter. I ask people these types of questions all day. Tell the hiring manager or recruiter that you are goal oriented, have the goals listed, when you would like to have then achieved and how you plan to achieve them. Group this answer just like you would if I were to ask you, "What's your biggest achievement? Do you have a time frame? What did you do to make it happen?".\nI hope this helped to frame your answer. Just be prepared.
I'm not sure if there are any places that have illustrations, but many sites give descriptions of medications as far as color, numbers, shapes, etc. If you have a pill and don't know it's identity, you should trash it, plain and simple. Unless of course, you found it in your child's (or someone you take care of) belongings, and want to get down to a possible problem. If you want pictures, head to the library or a book store - everyone has The Pill Book - Guide to prescription medications. It has pictures and descriptions for meds. Good luck!
The nursing home should have the resident's advocates phone number posted somewhere in the building, usually listed with the residents bill of rights. If you can't find it and don't want to ask then call the state nursing home association or the state department of health. \n\nBefore you file a formal complaint I urge you to be asolutely sure it is the act of abuse and not something beyond the staffs controll. Nursing homes are notoriusly understaffed and busy especially during the night that accidents do happen for various reasons. Do you see signs of abuse in other areas or just this incidence? Do some investigating before making the complaint please! Until you have sent more than a few intermittent hours at a nursing home you can't possibly know what constitutes abuse and what constitutes mitigating circumstances. Trust me I know from experience!

I don't know the answer to the secretarial part of your question - I doubt that Ms. Goodall attended an specific "school" to develop her secretarial skills. \n\nI can, however, answer your question with regard to her advanced training in anthropology - in 1964 or 1965, Goodall received a PhD in Ethology from Cambridge University. She had previously worked in Kenya with famed anthropologist Louis Leakey (initially as a secretary), beginning in 1957.

You know if you can stash 1 million away you will make 60,000 per year just off of the interest. So ask yourself if thats enough and what you have to do to get it. Companies dont offer retirement packages much anymore but employers are willing to match your contributions to 401k up to a dollar for every dollar you put in. However, rememeber if you dont get a retirement pkg. with benefits you will have purchase them yourself..... thats REALLY expensive. \nGood money from home.........do contract work, start a business, try to spin something off of what you already know. You will be more successful if you are doing something you love and are good at... so whats that?!?\nGood luck

From my experience: 1st the orthodontist will put spacers in your between your teeth(for about two weeks).\n2nd they put the actual brackets and wires on for the making of the braces. After your braces are on, you normally go back every month or few weeks for an adjustment and new bands are put on brackets. If you have an over or under bite, that will normally be corrected with rubber bands that hook on the top and bottom of your braces.3rd your treatment should almost be over soon and your braces will be removed. 4th you should RELIGOUSLY wear your retainers every night to bed. I have had my braces off now for 4 years, and I always get compliments on how straight my teeth are. I hope you are satisfied with your experience and your beautiful new smile.
Transmutation is a little used English word and biological term. In plain English, it means to change the nature of something. In biology, it means to change one species into another species; "speciation" is more commonly used. Transmutation is commonly used in nuclear physics where it refers to changing one element into another by changing the element's nucleus.\n\nIn the book, "Macroevolution" Steven Stanley lists a half dozen confirmed speciation events which occurred in modern times.\n\nOne classic example of beneficial mutations is the peppered moth. In its original form, about half of individuals were light and half dark. When pollution darkened tree trunks, the light peppered moths stood out and were preferentially eaten. The composition of the population shifted to mostly dark colored moths with only a few percent light colored ones.\n\nAdditions to the genetic code of a species occur when an error during reproduction results in (1) part of the species' DNA is copied twice and (2) DNA from another species is incorporated.\n\nIcarus62's three statements do deal with mIcroevolution. What you don't understand, is that mIcroevolution is simply mAcroevolution observed over a short time. Read his question!! Basically, he was saying, "We all agree that mIcroevolution occurs. Given this, what is to stop mAcroevolution from occuring?" \n\nTo be taken seriously, creationists will have to do something other than nitpick at evolutionary theory. They must develop theories of their own. Creationists are a laughingstock because they make no attempt at generating testable scientific theories, and then testing them.\n\nIcarus62, good job!
The function of a mouse on a computer is to ease the task of moving the cursor around on-screen in a graphical environment; it also allows for the selection and activation of various functions that are presented on-screen.\n\nA computer mouse may also have various other functions, such as scrolling up and down or side to side in a window that is larger than the screen (with a wheel that may be built-in), selecting items for copying into the computer's memory, etc.

OOh, a hard call, they are both excellent. Do you have any other criteria that you wish to consider in making your choice? Like legacy or where you want to live, or in what size community, or how liberal/conservative you want to live among, or family closer to one than the other?\n\nPersonally, I like Austin better, but I like A&M campus better, so it would be a tie for me also.
one ounce worth, but if it is too bulky they will send it thru the spurs, bulky material that cannot go thru the machine, and the person on the other end will have to pick up the postage due. I'd say that if you have trouble folding them and getting them into an envelope and sealing the envelope, you'd best put on another stamp. 5-6 pages are about all that an envelope can handle, without putting it into the non-machinable stage.

Wow. You would think a "cheeky" question would generate more answers. I grew up in the USA, so I'm not even positive what "cheeky" is. \n\nSelf confidence is a different matter. I suppose any number of self-help books and techniques could help you there.\n\nBut I think first of all, you need to be yourself. That way you will attract friends who like you. If you act cheeky and self confident, and feel otherwise, you will attract people you would rather not spend time with.\n\nHowever, that wasn't your question. \n\nOkay, I just looked up cheeky: Impertinently bold; impudent and saucy. I would say read cheeky material, hang out with cheeky friends, and it's bound to rub off. \n\nAs for self confident: showing poise and confidence in your own worth...it doesn't seem to be a synonym for cheeky. \n\nCheeky seems to hinge on a disregard for accepted measurements of society. Self confidence seems to require an understanding of accepted forms of evaluating an individual.\n\nPerhaps you could be a poised, polite, person...who is bold (cheeky) about facing life's hardships, but humble and self confident, when dealing with relationships.\n\n...you know, someone who faces life sarcastically, but treats people with serious consideration...\n\nNow that sounds like someone I could be friends with.

There are two factors to understand difference and similarities in humans. First is HEREDITY, every person inherited some of his characteristics from the parents, on the ratio of 4:1. This kind of characteristics can never be changed cause it is in the genes that makes you genetically similar to either your father or mother. This characteristics cannot be modified and are observed in the color of eyes; shape of the body, fingers, face; size of chest. Second is ENVIRONMENT, every person is also a product of environmental condition. This characteristics are the ones that can be modified externally. The color of your skin may change thru climatic condition, surgery, intake of chlorinated water; color of hair can change by exposure to salt water in the shore at all times, dye and etc.

Many (MATT.7:14)christians try to cite verses(1TIM.1:7)(MARK 7:7) to say the "10 commandments are done away with"; when they don't know what the passage is saying. They want to attack Jesus; so they're against Christ; so I wouldn't call them christians. But back to your question--\nSome (MATT.7:14)christians still keep the law because the Bible tells us to. These same christians follow Jesus (Col.2:6).\nHere are the verses for the 10 Commandments in New Testament:\n ROM.3:31; GAL.3:21; JOHN 14:15; 15:10; 1JOHN 3:4,24; 5:2-3; REV.12:17; 14:7,12

While the Steelers are playing below their potential, and a lot of that can be blamed on the coach, you absolutely can't fire Cowher. Think of what he's done long term, playoff appearances, division titiles, Super Bowls. The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise. He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways. Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year? If you want to blame someone, blame the offense and special teams for turning the ball over so much. That's the real reason we're 2-5 and not 4-3 or 5-2.\n\n\nBesides, he's going to retire in a year or two anyway.
Production of healthy germ cells (sperm & eggs) is regulated by specific hormones (chemical signals) in men and women. Infertility can result if there is imbalance in certain hormones and hence can be treated by external hormone supplements. On the other hand changing the body's natural hormone balance, carefully, can be one of the ways of contraception. \n\nFor a quick definition of hormones: please check answers for the question: functional difference of hormone and enzyme? By lovec27\n\nAs an example, the events regulated by hormones in a woman are mentioned here: An ovary in a woman's body would produce and release (ovulation) one egg a month and her body prepares (uterine wall thickening etc) to receive and nourish the embryo every month. All these normal events as well as pregnancy require several hormone-mediated changes in a woman's body. Some of these hormones are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen (E), progesterone (P). FSH and LH help the eggs grow and when they rise in quantity, E also increases and this causes ovulation. Later P helps the uterus to grow so that, in case there is fertilization, the embryo can settle on uterus wall and eventually grow into a baby. \n\nMale fertility is also regulated by hormones. While hormone-based contraception is available for women, it has not yet reached success for men.

If one party on a joint loan or credit card files for bankruptcy, they can be released from the debt, but any others on the loan will still be liable for repayment. Your credit rating is based on your repayment history. If an account it not included in a bankruptcy, all parties are still liable. A joint credit account may be closed to new purchases, but as long as the payments are made in a timely fashion, it will not effect your credit!

If you are stuck without a "weapon", try to "punch" the shark in the nose, and try to poke his eyes out. \n\nTo prevent an attack: Don't wear shiny or "flashy" watches or jewelry. Sharks are attracted to "blood" so don't have any major cuts or bleeding from wounds ,(or otherwise). They are slightly sensitive to the color "red", so don't wear all red shorts or wet-suit's. If you spearfish, don't carry your catch on your waist.\n\nAnd if you are on a sinking vessel, in the rigging/mast, and you only have 1 shot at shooting and hitting a scuba tank, wedged into the mouth of a charging white shark, say a prayer to Rory Sheider and make sure you HIT that TANK! lol
Many states (such as NY) have laws that allow mothers to drop off an unwanted baby at a firehouse or a police station. No questions will be asked. Its to prevent people from dumping unwanted children in the trash or just abandoning them someplace else unsafe like the bathroom in a fast food restaurant.
divide the minutes you have been given by 60 then multiply by 100\n\n\neg 30 minutes would be 30/60 = 0.5 x 100 = 50%\n\nand as 20 minutes is one third of an hour (ie 33.3%) it stands that\n20/60x100=33.3%

you will need about 5 days with no stress for your arms to fully recover - you could do a leg workout though\n\nand when you go back learn from the lesson - make progress slowly!\n\nafter a hard training make sure you stretch - then use hot-cold showers for 10 minutes and if you have access to it a whirlpool or spa bath \n\n\nyou can also ice areas that have been worked very hard for 10-15 min every hour \n\n\na bath with epsom salts helps as does an ibuprofen\n\nmake sure you hydrate during and after training and have a protein shake and some fruit as soon as possible after training
Its the worst. It would happen to me at night...maybe after a hard running day.......i would wake up and my legs would have all this "energy" or something....THEY would keep ME awake...it really sucked.

1. try to write on a lower speed\n2. Sometimes dvd-rw don't have a large enough buffer to hold data and on buffer memory down the error occurs, so you have to let the comp just to write the disk and close other apps\n3. I could be because of the files you want to write, they could be corrupted or, I don't know, they do not have the proper access property\n(4). Clean disk may occur when the inserted cd is clean and you try to write(continue) a multisession disk.\n(5). Sometimes there are incopatibilityes of drive with the cd/dvd - my LG didn't wanted to write properly a sony cd-rw\n Good luck!
Several years ago I had an unusual experience concerning an uncle, a distant relative who lived over a thousand miles away. \n\nWhile driving my car I suddenly felt the unmistakable presence of this relative that I hardly even knew. He was more like someone I had heard about than someone I knew. It was very strange; it felt as though I was momentarily lifted right out of my physical body. I seemed to be suspended somehow beyond space and time, bathed in a love so intense It felt like I could have just disappear into it at any moment if It would have let me. It only lasted for a few seconds, but it seemed to last forever at the same time. I realize how crazy this must sound. The experience was so strong that at first I was afraid I was loosing my grip on reality. I finally managed to chalk it up to an over active imagination.\n\nThree days later I got a call from my aunt telling me that this uncle we are talking about had gone into a coma and died the day I had the experience. It felt like ice water had been poured down my back when she told me this. I had lost any real ideas of God or faith and had become somewhat of an atheist. Needless to say this experience caused me to rethink some of the conclusions I had come to. \n\nI feel blessed to now understand that even in our darkest confusion something loves us so much that it went out of its way to assist me and bring me back to a state of absolute certainty about Gods love for us.\nDuring the experience it seemed like there was a vast amount of information that I was somehow allowed access to. One thing that I came away from this experience understanding beyond any shadow of a doubt was that any Idea that God is unhappy with us or would judge or allow us to be punished for any reason is simply impossible. \n\nI can’t explain the love I felt with words. They simply don’t make words big enough or complete enough to do this. The only way I can begin to convey this love to you is to say that there was simply nothing else there. Nothing but love. No hint of judgment, no displeasure of any sort. It is as though God sees us as being as perfect as we were the day we were created. It is only in our confused idea of ourselves that we seem to have changed.\n\n I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck. Love and blessings. \n\nYour brother don

Lately you find that you have a problem remembering, such things as a person’s name and the date that events are held on. You would like to improve your memory, but you don’t know where to begin to accomplish a greater memory. \n\n\nDifferent parts of the brain, handle different types of remembering tasks, such as recalling a person’s phone number versus remembering a person’s car. \n\nPeople tend to remember things differently through the use of dreferential senses, which means seeing something versuses hearing it. \n\nThis approach acknowledges, that specific memory stategies, are appropriate for different memory tasks. Memory strategies must be talented, to meet the individual’s memory needs. \n\nThis approach also recognizes that memory can be affected by many factors, including cognitive, which involves knowledge about memory strategies and some non-cognitive, which deals with such \n\nthings as overall fitness, mood and health. \n\n\nThere’s a method of memory called the Holistic view of memory. This approach is based on the concept of an individual’s memory readiness. \n\n\nScientists and health-care say that memory readiness can be improved, with a person’s attitude physical condition, their \n\nemotional state, conversational skills and the use of physical memory aids. These aids can be used in improving practical memory performance. \n\n\nTests have shown that monentary memory can vary at particular times, which can happen during the course of the day, course of the week or month. \n\n\nPeople tend to believe that their memory skills, are poorer than they really are. \n\n\nImproving your memory can be done at anytime. It doesn’t matter if your young, old, brilliant or average. Your memory can still be improved to remember better. \n\n\nThere’s no magic pill that can be taken to improve ones memory. To improve one’s memory, a person has to access the state of various memory abilities and then this adds to a person’s memory \n\nskills one at a time. \n\n\nSometimes if a person is stressed or has a cold their memory can be affected. Some nutritionists believe that vitamins help improve memory. \n\n\nThere are various memory techniques, that a person can do to improve their memory. \n\n\nOne method is the mnemonics method. This method is used for remembering information, that’s otherwise quite difficult to recall. The principle of mnemonics, is to use as many of the \n\nbest functions of the human brain, as possible to code information into the memory. The mnemonics method uses the human brain that’s used to code and interpret complex stimuli-images, colour, structure, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, emotion and languages. The brain uses these to make sophisticated interpretations, of the environment. These features are what the \n\nhuman memory is made of. \n\n\nInformation presented to the brain to be remembered,is all from one source, which is normally words on a page. Language or words \n\non a page reflects, are of the most important aspect of the human evolution. Mnemonics seeks to use all of these resources, by coding the language and the numbers in sophisticated striking \n\nimages, which flow into stronger images then are actually coded. Both information and structure of the information which is, to be recalled later. This method is simple and easy to understand. Remembering names is important, but such things as remembering, a pack of cards is just an amusing sideline. \n\n\nWhen remembering a person’s name, you can improve memory by using face association. With this technique, when you are introduced to a person examine the person’s face. Find an unusual ffeature of the person’s face. Create an association with the person’s face and the name will be in your memory. Also use repetition \n\nwhen being introduced, ask for the name to be repeated, use the name yourself, as much as possible. The more you hear the person’s name, the more the name will sink in your memory. \n\n\nW

Hello, \n My name is Rod and I'm 36. I think that part of the problem is that a lot of guys just dont have respect for women, or they disrespect thinking that they are cool and they are not even putting the shoe on the other foot because if they were being sincere and some women started bashing them I dont think that they would like to be treated like that. Kinda like the pot calling the kettle black. hope this helps and good luck in your search.

Good question! But if you watch this show as well as "Most Haunted" or any other "haunting" show, the evidence seems to suggest that it's THE PEOPLE who are haunted, not THE PLACE they're in. But if you want to see something eerie on film, go to LEMUR.COM and watch the video of the EMF meter moving by itself on the chair. Sure, anything can be faked, but this is the most compelling evidence of a haunting I've ever seen if it's for real...and I think it just might be.
Yes they do. It is your right that you earned that vacation and any sick leave you did not use. They owe all of that to you and have to give to you within a reasonible a mount of time. Contact the employer in writing...send the letter to your immediate supervisor, his/her supervisor and the head administrator. That way they have to give a response to resolve the issue.

The US Postal Service is always running at a loss. They have to try to cut that loss, so we're stuck with buying 2 cent stamps. Anywho, many companies, ie. credit card companies, will pay for the missing postage when it's addressed to them. That's how my husband and I went for months without even realizing the rate had been changed.

The term "software" was first used in this sense by John W. Tukey in 1957. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. The concept of reading different sequences of instructions into the memory of a device to control computations was invented by Charles Babbage as part of his difference engine. The theory that is the basis for most modern software was first proposed by Alan Turing in an essay.
Sorry Gucci, for your first question, that was not quite right, it makes no sense. Go back to your question and 'modify' it and explain what you mean.

Remember when you FIRST enter the page, there is no such thing about the variable $do since $_POST array does not exist!\n\nI see multiple problems over there.\n- Your form has the method of POST, so why do you use GET ?\n + $do=$_GET['do']; should be $do=$_POST['do'];\n- Now since the variable do does not exist you could do a simple if statement that checks that. The function isset checks if that variable exists.\n + $do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n- But there is another problem, The hidden name for do does not exist.. So lets change it to do\n + <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n\n[now the overall code]\n=============================\n<html>\n<body>\n<?php\n\n// Lets initialize the variable\n$do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send' : 'ok';\n\n// Lets just display the current Action\necho 'ACTION:'.$do;\n\n// Check if the hidden variable was sent\nif ($do == 'send') {\n\n // Lets print out the post array\n var_dump($_POST);\n\n} else { ?>\n <form method="POST" action="">\n <p><input type="submit" value="Submit" name="submit"></p>\n <input type="hidden" name="do" value="ok">\n </form>\n<?php } ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n=============================\nI took out the other forms...\n\nThe above should work.. Now.. But why introduce another variable if you already have the submit variable intact? What you could do is say $do = isset($_POST['submit']) ? 'send' : 'Submit'; That will remove that hidden field. Another thing I realize is that your mixing HTML code with PHP code which is BAD PRACTICE. I recommend you to at least separate them, or if you don't want to use a templating engine, I recommend you do at least store the output in one variable like outvar = "". That will take out alot of issues in the future.\n\nAnyways.. Good Luck

Good question. Just FYI, embryo is used to cultivate virusses because the environment can be easily controlled, unlike that of an animal.\n\nEmbryo really don't have any disadvantages after you've discovered the method.\n\nAnimals have several however. He're a brief listing:\n\n- immune system response time (from infection to plasma b cell action)\n- immune system strength (number of plasma b cells)\n- immune system aggression (number of antigens created by plasma b cells)\n- inconsistant host cells\n\nControl is the key. Embryo cultivation allows for this. That's why it's used.

try this strategic trick:\n\n1. go to your bank first where you are familiar with the people. ask them for a loan, get the interest rate and the plan and all details, check for any hidden extras.\n\n2. check online at all the banks offers (including your bank) print the best offers that you may get (i am sure u will get a lower interest rate than your own bank) from reliable banks.\n\n3. now be very cunning: go to the first step with a twist, show them your research, and show them the best deal you have got from the internet.\n\n4. mostly they are ready to negotiate and ask them for a lower rate than the one you have researched. mostly they will discuss (privately with some hidden manager) and get back to you. \n\n5. if they give a lower rate you have striken a jackpot, if not go to the internet loan offer.\n\nhurrah now you can feel that consumer is a king. and you have nothing to lose.\n\ngood luck.

Both major parties have individuals who lean left or right, especially on particular issues. Liberals lean left or even far left. Conservatives lean right or even far right. Moderates are middle of the road on most issues and are present in both parties. There are also independents who are not a party and are not loyal to either party. They may be individuals who are even more left or right of center. Being left or right often refers to the fact that political bodies (such as Congress) are seated such that one party is together on the left of an aisle and the other party is on their right.\n\nLiberals and Conservatives often agree that something needs to be done but often not how to do it, or who should pay for it.\n\nPerhaps Welfare is a good example. Both Liberals and Conservatives support Welfare, however Liberals allowed the system to reach the point where many people believed that the Government owed then a living while Conservatives saw it as a bridge over troubled circumstances back to self-sufficiency. Welfare case workers feared losing their jobs if they did not maintain a long client list while others wondered why a low-paid worker should pay taxes to support a person who could work. Finding the happy medium (the job of the moderates?) is often difficulty.

Ditto on the first answer, it depends on your age, but if you really like her don't be afraid to wait for her:) trust me, if you're willing to wait and she sees that, you'll get major bonus points when the right time comes!! and while you're waiting for her to be 'ready', still be close with her - just make sure you don't pressure her too much or anything like that;)
One thing you could do to get an idea of a reasonable minimum age is do tests to quantify erosion rates for moving water over various rock strata, then estimate how long it takes to cut out something like the grand canyon. The age could of course be much more than this.\n\nAnother method might be to measure the depth of silt on the ocean floor. Believe it takes about a thousand years to deposit one inch. Again, just looking for a minimum. Ice cores in Antarctica can also take you back millions of years by counting up the annual layers.

A few suggestions:\n\n1) Dismantle the employment magnet. Heavily fine and/or jail employers that hire illegals.\n\n2) Stop offering social services to illegals (free emergency medical care, welfare benefits, social security benefits, education, in-state college tuition).\n\n3) Stop the crazy anchor baby practice.\n\n4) Stop offering amnesty to people that are here illegally. \n\n5) Do not offer any path to citizenship. Illegals must get in line and go through the process like everyone else. No special treatment. \n\n6) Enforce the border. Use whatever technology is necessary to keep illegals out.\n\n7) Develop a better system for verifying the status of an immigrant before he is hired.\n\n8) Send illegals back to where they came when they are caught.\n\nIf we stop coddling illegals and make life here less attractive, most will self-deport. \n\nI'm tired of hearing "well, most illegals are good people, work hard, BLAH,BLAH, BLAH." There are lots of good LEGAL immigrants and legitimate American citizens who work hard and whose resources are being stressed and lielihoods are being compromised by illegals who come to this country and have the nerve to start demanding rights.\n\nDo some research and see how the Senate's amnesty bill will affect population, the environment, social services, the economy, social security, etc. It is not good.

It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\n\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\n\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom. The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals. The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction. In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy). In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.

Well, as an RN student, I can give you some info. You can get an RN degree in 2-3 years. An LPN takes 2-2 1/2. Starting pay for an RN varies by the area of the country you live in, but here in the midwest, I can start at about $60K per year. LPN's is about half of that.

You would feel like the only thing you can think about is that person beyond a simple crush stage. Love is one of the most reconized entities that cant be seen with the eye. Its there but you cant see it. When you have a feeling for a person that takes over every possible thing in the worlds importance but that, LOVE. Nothing else matters in the world but that feeling for a person, LOVE. Love is a chemical release in the brain that tells you "more!" Love is a natural high, drug and emotion.
Because if they lie to you once, chances are they'll lie to you again.

Hi, it's a Civil War.\n\nThe American Civil War Homepage \n\nhttp://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/warweb.html\n\nThe American Civil War Homepage gathers together in one place hypertext links to the most useful identified electronic files about the American Civil War (1861-1865). \n\nResearch/Informational Sites\n\nhttp://www.historyplace.com/civilwar/index.html\n\nhttp://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ndlpcoop/nhihtml/cwnyhshome.html\n\nhttp://edtech.kennesaw.edu/web/civwar.html\n\nhttp://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivilwar.htm\n\nhttp://www.civilwarhome.com/indexcivilwarinfo.htm\n\nhttp://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0173280-0&templatename=/article/article.html\n\nhttp://www.civil-war.net/\n\nhttp://members.aol.com/teachernet/\n\nhttp://www.refdesk.com/facthist.html\n\nGood luck.\n\nKevin, Liverpool, England.

I have researched this for many an hour over the last 2 months and I am deeply disturbed by my findings. \n\nFor the most comprehensive answer watch "9/11 Mysteries":\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003&q=9%2F11+mysteries\nIt was started by 4 wodows from the WTC - they wanted to know exactly how and why their husbands died.\n\nIt will start a chain reaction. I am 31 and I have never seen such shocking news! I have checked and tripple checked the details on offical sites, news sites and other respected resources.\n\nYou can make your own conclusions about who created 9/11, who allowed it to happen, who knew about it in advance, who financed it and MOST IMPORTANTLY - look at who benifited and how it changed the world.\n\nSince 9/11 the American constitution has been taken from you. If Bush doesn't like you he can arrange for you to be locked up indefinately, without proof of a crime, he doesn't even need to accuse you of a specific crime. \n\nI am very glad to hear anyone ask this question. Please keep asking more and tell your friends your findings. Most of the mass media (TV and newspapers) are owned by 5 very powerful corperations - they control what you see. The internet is our lifeline - use it while you can.\n\npeace.
there is no such thing if you are looking for NBC or CBS etc..\nthe closest thing i can find is\nhttp://www.aol.com/videos\nit has a few old tv shows that you can watch full screen in in2tv.
Congratulations!!!! You need to go ahead and tell your parents now. Your mom is going to want to help plan your wedding, and she'll be a big help. As for the invitations, I would wait until a month and a half before the wedding to send those out. Have fun doing all of this. I have been helping my sister do hers and we have had a blast! You need to start looking for your dress and your brides maid dresses too. This is the longest process of the whole thing. It takes about a month to get your dress back after your final fitting done. Good luck with the wedding planning and your life with your soon to be husband, and remember, always keep the line of communication open!
Buying a sportscar with daddy's money has got to be every young man's dream. But Nikolay Smolensky, 23, has gone a one step further. \nThe young Russian has bought the entire iconic sportscar maker TVR from motoring legend Peter Wheeler. \n\nMr Smolensky, who is Russia's youngest millionaire, is believed to be a friend of Russian billionaire and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich - although by comparison he is hardly well off. \n\nHis personal wealth is estimated at just $100m (£55m), just a fraction of Mr Abramovich's $14bn fortune. \n\nStill, for a businessman in his early 20s, Mr Smolensky's financial achievement is impressive - even if it does not offer a guarantee of future acumen or success. \n\nDaddy's boy \n\nSo far, Mr Smolensky does not seem to be a self-made millionaire. Rather, much of his money is reported to have come from the businesses created by his father: Russia's first private banker, the oligarch Alexander Smolensky. \n\n \nBank customers, desperate to withdraw their cash from SBS-Agro in 1998. \n\nThe elder Smolensky's first bank, Stolichny, appeared on the market in February 1991, ten months before the final collapse of the USSR. \n\nA year later, Stolichny and two other Russian banks set up the country's first debit card processing system, and started opening offices in some of Russia's most remote locations. \n\nBy 1998, Alexander Smolensky owned the country's largest private network of banking offices and a large stake in the debit card scheme, which had 1.2 million subscribers. \n\nHe had also merged his operations Agroprombank, which served the country's huge agricultural sector. Following the merger, Mr Smolensky's group - renamed SBS-Agro - gained considerable lobbying power. \n\nMany analysts say that Mr Smolensky, even though disliked by the Kremlin, was in a perfect position to influence some of the government's key ministers. \n\nUnpopularity \n\nBut then came August 1998: "Black August", as Russians dub it, when the banking system collapsed amid the country's worst financial meltdown. \n\nMany Russian analysts accuse Mr Smolensky of trying to cash in on a bear market for the rouble shortly before and during the 1998 crisis. Many see him as one of the behind-the-scenes actors in that year's Russian economic drama. \n\nShortly after the Kremlin announced that Russia would default on its national debt, the national currency plunged and dozens of small and medium-sized financial institutions shut their doors. \n\nMr Smolensky's banking group was among those that had collapsed. Along with other banks, it said there was no money left to return the deposits held in SBS-Agro, and no money available to save private investors from their plight. \n\nThe news bewildered many Russians, who had desperately wanted to believe that bankers were at least trying to help them. \n\nThousands of Russians have spent years trying to reclaim the money which they had deposited in SBS-Agro. \n\nIn 2002, most of these debts were repaid by other banks. Even so, if you ask an average Russian to give the name of the country's most unpopular oligarch, many would mention Alexander Smolensky. \n\nRevival \n\nMr Smolensky's banking business - now renamed OVK - has since been resuscitated and, even though he has moved to Austria, he retains some control of the company through his son Nikolay, who was until recently chairman of the OVK board. \n\nBut in July 2003 the long story of the Smolenskys' banking involvement seemed to have come to an end. \n\nOVK was sold to Vladimir Potanin, an oligarch rumoured to be very close to the Kremlin, and both Nikolay and Alexander joined the unofficial club of wealthy unemployed Russians. \n\nBy purchasing TVR, Nikolay Smolensky has now put the family back into the spotlight. \n\nSo far, the new owner of the legendary British car manufacturer has only promised to keep the company's wheels rolling. \n

Your logic is flawed: humans did not evolve from apes, but rather ape-like creatures. No organisms can have evolved from extant organisms. That is, if it is around today, nothing else around today evolved from it. Both humans and other apes diverged from an ape-like common ancestor and both extant apes and humans are equally evolved. \n\nAs far as your question, the "man" refered to in such statement is defined as all humans. Both male and female humans evolved slowly at the same time through selective pressures on both genders.
She was a human.Her real name was Helen Kane,who was a famous singer in the twenties.

SODIUM ERYTHORBATE IS PRODUCED BY FERMENTATION OF CORN SUGAR.\nSodium erythorbate is NOT made from earthworms. This was a popular rumor.\n\nSodium erythorbate is an antioxidant which can be used in various food systems: e.g. meat, fish, beverages, fruit and vegetables, etc. Chemically, it is the sodium salt of erythorbic acid which is recognized as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is an epimer (structural mirror image) of sodium ascorbate and is identical in antioxidant effect.\n\nEribate® brand sodium erythorbate is produced by fermentation of corn sugar to meet the specifications outlined in the Food Chemicals Codex (F.C.C.). Eribate® is proven nontoxic in all applications.\n\nSodium erythorbate may be used to preserve freshness in fruit and vegetables. It does this by preventing discoloration and development of off-flavors.\n\nSodium erythorbate serves as an inhibitor of enzymatic browning by scavenging oxygen and by reducing quinones back to polyphenol compounds before they can undergo the reactions to produce brown pigments. Fruit and vegetables can be protected by spraying or dipping them in an aqueous solution of sodium erythorbate. \n\n\n\nErythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are chemical isomers of ascorbates, they are effective antioxidants for applications that do not require a nutritional claim for vitamin activity. The efficiency of erythorbates as antioxidants depends upon the particular food system, the compounds to be protected, the amount of metal contamination, and the amount of oxygen to be removed form the system. Sodium erythorbate is not fat soluble and is most useful as antioxidant in aqueous systems. Erythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are permitted food ingredients in the U.S. Japan and European Union.

I hate to say it, but how people look at interacial relationships will differ greatly from place to place. I personaly have no problem, and think that interacial relationships help broaden the perspectives of both individuals. There will always be people against it, and it's hardest when one of your family members is truly against it. All I can say is that if you love the other person it can be great, but stay light hearted with other people and understand that there are a**holes and there are open minded people.

The Ronald McDonald House flew her and the baby there and paid for her whole stay, they helped with all the medical bills. They really looked out for their family and the baby. Now they baby is doing great.
Muscle fibers have long proteins called actin that are disposed as "railways" and form a long chain al along the muscle. \nA second protein, miosin, has a movable head that "crawls" up the actin, gragging a limited amount of muscle mass with it. The movement of millions of these proteins produces the contraction of the muscle.\nFor this, muscles need two things: Calcium that allows the miosin head to "glue" to the actin, and ATP (an energy carrier molecule that is produced by the cellular respiration) that gives it the energy to move one step and be dettached for a new cycle.\nWhen exercising a lot, you might consume all of the cellular oxygen or the glucose (the sugar from which cells extract the enrgy). This means a drop in ATP levels. So theres is calcium, the miosin attaches itself to the actin, but cannot move. This means the muscle gets cramped. This is the explanation for Rigor mortis too.\nThe cramps that occurr by dehidration or lack of salts (including calcium) don't have to do with muscular function. Rather, they stimulate the excitability of the nerves that tell the muscle to contract, so they might spontaneusly and continously produce this state, called tetanus (with equal or very similar symptoms to cramps).\nThe lactic acid acumulation someone told you about earlyer is not a cramp. It rather produces the pain you feel AFTER you exercise and rest your muscle, because this is a very insoluble compound that forms abrsive cristals inside your muscle cells, which are very painfull when you move it. Beware of them, because the more painfull it is, the bigger the cellular damage is. And muscle cells are not that easily replaced. If you feel this pain, try not to force the sore muscle.\nThe cramp and the lactic acid acumulation (don't know the word, in spanish it is "agujeta") have, however, teh same origin: An exercise too strong that consumes more energy than the muscular cell can produce by respiration (there's not enough oxygen in the cell to ope with the demand). So if you get a cramp during exercise, very likely you'll get Agujetas the next day.

Not to a pendulum but to control oscillations in a circuit sense, on ecould use a phase lock loop (pll). Its whole life revolves around using a reference oscillator, locking onto it and outputting a new oscillation of frequency f or some multiplier of f.\nThe major components are as follows\n1) Phase Detector: It determines if you are locked or not\n2) Charge pump: Produces an up or down control signal depending on the output of the Phase Detector to either speed up or down f\n3)Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO): Takes the up/down control signal from the Charge Pump and produces a new f that is either faster or slower. This is the output of your new oscillator.\n4)Feedback loop: Taken from the VCO, it is compared with the reference oscillator you started with and determines if the two are locked. If they are, you have a locked pll and can know that the output from the VCO is a good clean clock.\n\nThis is a reeeeaaaallll basic overview. Some pll designer will probably come in and correct me!

One of my wisdom teeth was partially decayed and was causing severe pain... after suffering for 3 days because of the decay I had all 4 wisdom teeth pulled. Its been almost 1 and 1/2 weeks and the area where the decayed tooth was at still has not healed and I am still in sever pain! (Possible Dry Socket). Which is why I have been up since 3am..... Ahhhhhh. But please go, don't wait like I did and go when its an extreme emergency

In Romans 1:20, Paul says "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."\n\nI take this to mean that, if you aren't given the opportunity to learn about Jesus and what God did through him, you can still be saved if you pursue God in the best way you know him. So, the proverbial person in Africa who worships God as he is seen through nature, but never learns about Jesus can still be saved.\n\nBasically, I think God in his infinite wisdom and justice, has a formula that's a bit more complicated than the version explicitly laid out in the Bible (just as I don't believe Hell really is a bit fiery furnace), though I do think those who do learn about Christianity and then still scorn God's offer are setting themselves up for a fall.

1) Push at a comfortable speed, remember the faster you go the better the pop. \n2) Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches under your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail. \n3) Squat, so you can spring yourself up. \n4) Kick your back foot down so you can pop as you jump up, your front foot should rub upward on your griptape. \n5) Make sure you tuck your knees to your chest, picking up your back foot as well to level the board at a good height. REMEMBER you are jumping forward. \n6) Then come down comfortably, both feet on the board. It will look better if both your feet are over the bolts as well as lessen the stress of impact \n7) Finally bend your legs as you touch down to give it that smooth style and roll away stocked\n\n\n\nu have to remember to slide your foot foward,\n\nkeep practicing, i can now ollie almost two feet!

I had the same problem (now solved). I got the advice from an allergy advice website. Ban the cat from the place your bf sleeps (even when he's not there). Vacuum floors/carpets every day when your boyfriend is out and open all the windows for at least 20 minutes afterwards. Also vacuum sofas and cushions and the cat's bed every day. Now for the mad-sounding bit - wash the cat! Every day, gently pour a jug of warm water over the cat as he/she sits in the bath/sink, then run your hands over the cat to squeeze out the excess. When dry, groom the cat for 10 minutes. Do this daily for one week, then once weekly after that. It sounds a lot of work but it all takes around half an hour a day. It definitely worked for me and my bf. Good luck!

There was a competition to cross the English Channel doing only the breaststroke. \n\nThe three women who entered the race were a brunette, a redhead and a blonde. After approximately 14 hours, the brunette staggered up on the shore and was declared the fastest breaststroker.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled up onto the shore and was declared the second place finisher. \n\nNearly 4 hours after that, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers.\n\nWhen the reporters asked why it took her so long to complete the race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like I'm a sore loser, but I think those two other girls were using their arms."\n\nAnother one!\n\nA Blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so She goes out and buys a gun.\n\nShe goes to his apartment unexpectedly and sure enough, she opens the door and finds him in the arms of a redhead.\n\nWell, the blond is angry, She opens her purse to take out the gun but as she does so, she is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head.\n\nThe boyfriend yells "No, honey, don't do it."\n\nThe blond replies "Shut up, you're next."

Tension in the string is the force acting on the string.\n\nFor time being forget about the pulley.\n\nOne end of a rope is tied to a pole at the ground. Suppose you are pulling the rope from the other end.\n\nYou are exerting a force on the rope so as to increase its length.\n\nIf the rope is made of rubber you can see the increase in length.\n\nIf it is a steel rope, you cannot visualize the increase in length; but still it increases in its length. \n\nIf you exert a heavy force the rope breaks into two.\n\nSuppose you are not giving such a force. When the force is within a limit, the rope extends to a length which is determined by the applied force.\n\nWhen the increase in length is stopped, you and the rope are at rest; not moving further. \n\nNow consider the rope alone. What are the forces acting on the rope?\n\nTwo forces are acting on the rope, each at one end of the rope.\n\nSince the rope is not moving, by applying the law of forces, we come to a conclusion that these two forces are equal but opposite.\n\nNote that if the rope is moving with a varying speed, we cannot come to this conclusion.\n\nThe forces in the rope are called tension.\n\nNow suppose you know the value of the force, say 10N, that you have applied to the rope. It is obvious that this force which is pulling the rope and hence the value is 10N.\n\nNow coming to the pulley, a rope is passing through the pulley and one end carries a load and at the other end you are pulling it.\n\nSuppose the load and the end in which you are applying force is at rest ;( not moving)\n\nIi is similar to the above case; instead of the pole to which the rope is tied, here\nthe load is acting as a pole. (The load is also at rest).\n\nSince the system as a whole is at rest. The force you are applying must be equal to the load. Suppose if the load is 10N, you are applying 10N. \n\nActually you are applying 10 N to one end of the rope. The rope must move with this force; but for the load which is pulling it on the opposite direction.\nThus in the rope one end is pulled by you and the other end is pulled by the load.\n\nThe rope is under the tension of 10N force.\n\nNow you know the direction of tension in the rope also.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which load is connected. The load is pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is 10N down ward.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which you are pulling. You are pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is also 10N down ward.\n\nThe pulley is acted on by two forces on either side each equal to 10N, totalling 20N. \n\nIf there is no force acting upward on the pulley, the pulley will come down due the 20 N forces. \n\nTherefore, the pulley is pulled upward by a force of 20N by the one which is connected to the pulley.\n\nIf the load is moving with changing speed, the tension in the rope will be different.\n\nIf the concept of tension when the rope is at rest is understood, then it will be easy if even if the rope is having some acceleration.
Light is a form of energy. It has both the properties of wave as well as particle. A body becomes visible when light is emitted by or reflected from it and this light on entering our eyes enabled us to see the objects. But light itself is invisible. It's the fastest thing in universe. There is no need of any material medium for the transmission of light.
Your disability does not automatically qualify you as having been mentally incapacitated during the period in question. Each state has a different definition of "mental incapacitation," but most will define it as something similar to "the inability to make decisions to which legal consequences may attach." This can be due to an actual medical disability (a mentally retarded individual may be found to be mentally incapacitated), or it could be situational (the fit of rage rendered you unable to make rational decisions). It could even be wholly unrelated to any mental condition whatsoever (a perfectly normal, mentally healthy 5-year old doesn't have the mental capacity to enter into a binding contract).\n\nIf you file your claim, and it is challenged as untimely, you will need medical evidence establishing that your particular disability qualified you as "mentally incapacitated" during the period at issue. \n\nOn a wholly different note, most states have a Tort Claims Act that will require you to jump through various other hoops prior to filing a claim against a government entity. Be sure to look into those requirements as well.

"All men are created equal" That only applies until, by legislation, special rights are granted to a group of which you are not a part of.

I agree with you 100% . I too am an athiest, but I have great respect for the teachings of the religions, whether Islam, Jdaism, Christianity, Hindu etc. The basic belief is summed up by the Christian commandment of "do unto others..." \n\nThe problem comes when we get an "our god's better than your god" type of confrontation, because that is just using religion as a tool to promote racism, and that is absolutely against everything that most religions stand for!\n\nI'll get off my soap box now.
Two things have to happen brutha. They need a scoring winger. An accomplished winger that can just hammer the puck home. Remember the San jose Sharks last season? Cheechoo Thornton, Cheechoo Thornton. It can't happen when you got ECHL'ers like John Madden raping you all game. One line can't do it!\n\nAlso, they need a SOLID Defenseman. Orpik's return will help, but Scudichar have to go. I don't mind Scuderi positionally but look at Carolina's top 6 last playoffs. I honestly think Letang should be up because he is a right hand shot and can get the puck to the net. The Pens have a tendency to keep US born defensemen. Nothing wrong with that but Letang was a perfect replacement for Jackman. Jackman had an absolute rocket. Now all of our defensemen are left-handed shots. Not good for one timers on a PP. Kovalchuk scores all his goals waiting on the left point for one-timers (he is a right handed shot.) We have nobody to put over there to rifle it. \n\n\nTo sum it up I'd say go after Glen Murray. Lose Malone. He is totally disinterested in playing professional hockey. We have to go for this thing now before the salary cap kicks in. Glen Murray straight up (or even Boyes which was rumoured before) for Ryan Malone and a pick and LeClair.!\n\nAs for D? Mark Eaton is a hell of a defenseman. I am surprised -- never seen him play before. We need a Phaneuf style defenseman. I know he is impossible to get. But someone that can impose fear in an offence. Fleury got ran over at least 3 times versus LA the other night and there was no one on the ice to help him out. Cairns is coming back but he is getting like Hatcher - he's not the greatest skater. \n\nRay Shero will figure something out!!
This phrase has been poll tested.\n\nIn fact the funniest thing about it is it had to be kept three words and under.\n\nAs you may remember before the war\n\n White House chief of staff Andrew Card or Rove told The New York Times ``From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August.''\n\nThese are buisness people, they are marketing to the less intellectualy disearning. In my opinion only i have always believed that corpratist want a less educated popultaion because they make better consumers.\n\nThe war is a prouduct they must sell. \n\nIf they repeat the slogan long enough the need for real issue debate ends. \n\nThe debate is simple...logically we must pull our troops out one day....in the future....it has to happen. \notherwise the debate the Republican Party is running is simple.\n\nNever leave Iraq [r] vs. We have to leave sometime [d].

I think you really have to ask yourself if you are truly unhappy with things the way they are? I know that you would like to feel a 100% commitment from this guy, but if he's shying away, perhaps you really don't need anything more than what you already have. I feel that in most instances, to make a relationship work demands communication, and if you tell him what is important to you and he doesn't want to acknowledge your needs, then that isn't a relationship as much as getting comfortable with someone. The guy sounds like a keeper who is just looking to stay away from going thru a hassle of a wedding (don't try telling me weddings aren't a hassle). I am not a doctor, but I sometimes feel the same way about my girlfriend. Maybe she's a little too wrapped up in her life to truly notice what I am looking for. We've been together for 10 years and still aren't married. I want it, she says no rush. (Reversed roles) Call me old fashioned. Hope this has helped somehow...\n\nTake care and let me know how you make out
If that picture is of you then the only reason I wouldn't go out with you is because I would go to jail for messing around with a 15 year old. Your looks are going to continue to chance over the next 4 or 5 years and it looks like you are off to a good start.
It is irrelevant that the terminal ray is pointing whatever number. tan(0) is just always 0.\n\nQuestion: Rewrite x in radian as quantity in degree.\nAnswer: We use the ratio pi(radian):180(degree).\nIf we let d be the quantity in degree for x in radian, we can find d from the following ratio equation.\n\nx(radian) : d(degree) = pi(radian) : 180(degree)\n=> (pi)d = 180(x)\n=> d = 180(x)/pi\n\nIn your question, x = 3pi/4. Hence, d = 180(3pi/4)/pi = 135 (degree).

WC 1966 in England.\n\nMost modern balls are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is similar to the polyhedron known as the truncated icosahedron, except that it is more spherical, because the faces bulge due to the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in the United States. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nOlder balls were usually stitched from 18 oblong non-waterproof leather panels, similar to the design of modern volleyballs and Gaelic footballs, and laced to allow access to the internal air bladder. This configuration is still common, as are more novel ones, such as the 26-panel Mitre PRO 100T, and the 14-panel Adidas Teamgeist. There are also indoor footballs, which are made of one or two pieces of plastic. Often these have designs printed on them to resemble a stitched leather ball.
I play that game. It has become very popular. I think it increases your mentality and brain skills. It causes you to think and really concentrate.
a team captain is one who motivates and encourages the team, usually the team votes on who will "lead" the team. the captains are the ones the team looks up to. a team would still be fine without a captain, but it seems as if a player will work harder to either to win the role as captain or the team is more organized with someone to lead them in warm-up. basically the captain is the spirt of the team, a light of hope by encouraging the team even as they lose. :)
There are an infinite number of personal views, philospohies, beliefs on why we exist, what purpose does it serve, why does the universe exist. Everyone \nhas got something to say but I see the ultimate truth and reality for the meaning of life is the same belief shared by many. There's absolutley positively no meaning to life. It's pointless, meaningless and \nabsolutely futile without any purpose at all. And anyone that believes otherwise is simply fooling themselves.

Actually, Lybia has been working for many years to get off of the list. The list of State Supporters of Terrorism is compiled by the US State Department, and it is based on many different things, one of which includes attempts at acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn addition to reaching a financial understanding with the families of the Lockerbee tragedy, in the last few years Lybia has renounced their stockpile of various weapons and has invited international inspection. The Lybian government has also stated that it will no longer give monetary and protective aid to international terrorists. \n\nTo answer your other question, the Venezuelan government continues to offer monetary and protective support to leftist guerillas and terrorists in Columbia, which does a great deal to extending the tragedy in that part of the world. Yes, part of the problem between the USA and Venezuela is economic, part is personal, but part is also about the legitimate danger of terrorism to the region.
Yes iTunes radio is free.\nA dozen or so music categories (Rock, Alt...)\nEach category displays various station streams.\nSome need broadband connections to listen to cleanly without stops.

I guess you need to be careful when learning about the introverts. And I find this question is a bit offensive, because you measure us from an extrovert point of view.\n\nYou must know, that most of the psychological criteria just list the condition of certain mental illnesses or disorders. There are no clear words or lines in the DMS-IV-TR, says that we introverts are prone to suffer from Neurosis.\n\nI believe there are many different reasons behind for people to suffer depression, anxiety, low sense of self-worth, and so on. Having such conditions, doesn't really mean that a person suffering from Neurosis.\n\nWhy we introverts have similar conditions? Is just simply from excessive loneliness that we experiencing, which cause by incapable of making and keeping friends.

John 1\n1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning. 3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.\n\n6There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. 7He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. 8He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.\n\n10He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.\n\n14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\nJesus is The Word.

While reading a lot of what people post and answer on here, I feel dismayed that so many people are not only "okay" with the status quo, but they harass, label and judge those who question it.\n\nI despise it when people answer something "b/c it's against the law," well that's just fantastic, but it's not a valid answer. When growing up, did anybody like it when their parents said "b/c i said so." Nope!\n\nPeople, I have found, are reluctant to invite controversy, to debate and to use their minds openly and freely. It's absolutely fine to agree w/ the establishment, but it's also ok to disagree; the people who make the laws are working for us, don't forget that. These laws are meant for our benefit, to protect us and maintain a stable society - not to keep us opressed and under their submission (yeah, I know it's hard to believe that sometimes).\n\nSo to whom ever reads this and the person who posted this question, I hope that Americans start realizing that 1) the media have their own money/power-making agendas, and delivering truth is a biproduct 2) there are two sides to every story 3) criticizing the status quo is not the equivalent of becoming a rebel anarchist...it's simply using the brain that you were born with.

Pull out your periodic table (I would but I don't have one anymore)...\n\nRemember to answer practically every question you have listed, just remember these two facts:\n\nThe Atomic number of an Element = the number of protons.\n and the number of protons = the number of electrons.\n\nThe number of neutrons in an Element = the atomic weight - the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons)\n\nAnd last hint: The number of neutrons is usually close to the number of protons give or take a few.\n\nSo to answer the first question: Find two elements with an atomic number close to 10, and you'll probably find the ones with 10 neutrons.\n\nThe second question (I'll give you this one since I don't need a periodic table for this one) :p \n2 protons means the Element has an atomic number of 2 (i.e. He, or helium)\n\nThe third question (I'll give you this one too since I still have this memorized from high school... I think) ;)\n3 electrons means 3 protons means an atomic number of 3 (i.e. Li, or lithium)\n\nYou figure out the rest... oh except question G... Ferrum...Ferrous... Element Fe... "iron"

The answer is D, if you're talking about the modern cabinet.\n\nIt was formerly called the Veterans Administration, also called the VA, which was established July 21, 1930 to consolidate and coordinate government activities affecting war veterans. The VA incorporated the functions of the former U.S. Veterans' Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions of the Interior Department and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.\n\nOn October 25, 1988, President Reagan signed legislation creating a new federal Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs to replace the Veterans Administration effective March 15, 1989.\n\nIn both its old and new forms, the VA drew its mission statement from President Abraham Lincoln's eloquent Second Inaugural Address. The specific phrase quoted by VA is: "...to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan..."

Otolaryngology is the branch of medicine that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose, throat, and head & neck disorders. The full name of the specialty is otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Practitioners are called otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, or sometimes otorhinolaryngologists (ORL). A somewhat outdated, but nevertheless commonly used, term for this speciality is ENT (ear nose and throat).\n\nOtolaryngologists are medical doctors who complete at least five years of surgical residency training (one year in general surgery, four years in otolaryngology - head and neck surgery). Following residency training, some otolaryngologists elect to complete advanced subspeciality fellowships which are usually one or two years in duration. As with all medical fellowships, acceptance is highly competitive.\n\nFor more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology
That's a pretty heavy statement..."the Peruvian government is flooding our streets with cocaine". By the way, Colombia produces more cocaine than Peru, so maybe their government is doing it too? Most of the cocaine produced in Peru is financed by the major Colombian cartels, that doesn't mean the Colombian government endorses drug trafficking.\n\nAnyway, Peru's national products are copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydro power, natural gas, coffee, cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes, corn, plantains, grapes, oranges, coca; poultry, beef, dairy products; fish. As you can see, cocaine is not part of the list.\n\nAs someone already said, the problem is more complex than that. Yes, there are some Peruvian government officials involved in drug trafficking, as well as there are American officials involved too. But to say that the government of Peru is directly involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine is completely erroneous.

It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool. We all do it. You should try sleeping in a different position. It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder. It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist. If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.

You must mean universe, not galaxy.\n\nWe live on planet Earth, which is in a solar system. A solar system consists of a star (we call ours the sun), planets which orbit the star, and maybe other debris and gases. Solar systems are in galaxies. Our galaxy is the Milky Way. It's a barred spiral galaxy and it's a big one. Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. That means, traveling at the speed of light, it'd take you 100,000 years to get from one side to the other if you went straight across the disk.\n\nOutside of the galaxy is mainly empty space (heck, galaxies have trillions of stars and massive clouds of dust and gases and most of it is still mainly empty space). There may be rogue stars or junk that got flug out of a galaxy here and there but they're generally few.\n\nDoes the universe have a boundary? Probably, but the nature of it probably isn't anything we'd be familiar with...not like a wall or anything. Can we ever get there? No, we are well within the universe and even if we could travel the speed of light and live forever, it's thought the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate so we'd still never get to the edge, and if by change we mysteriously appeared at the edge and move along with it, there may be some physical process which would prevent us from realizing it.

Ideally you want to take your body weight times 12 or 13 to get the number of daily calories for weight loss. So for example if you weigh 150 you would need to eat 1800 calories a day (150 x 12). You can divide this over 5-6 meals a day so you would have 300 calories for each of your 6 meals. Eating smaller meals every 2 to 2.5 hours will help in keeping you feeling full throughout the day and you should be drinking plenty of water as well. These meals should consist of protein, healthy carbs, and healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, small amount of nuts), these are monosaturated, and healthy fats, which aid in weight loss. Cut out saturated and trans fat. Cut out all processed and fast food and alot of sugar and white bread, and rice, etc. This will get you on track to lose 1-2 lbs a week, if you're losing more than that add more calories, if you're losing less than 1lb a week, slowly cut the calories a bit ; like 250-300 per day. Good luck
please! take my advise. take some lube and keep it by the edge of the pool, or else the water with wash away your natural lubricants and it will either hurt or he will not be able to enter you. you can still get pregnant in water, but using a condom in the water makes it more difficult to have sex comfortably. its your choice, but i would go on birth control so you wouldnt have to worry about it.
The fire is believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the capsule's 30 miles (50 km) of wiring. Due to the pure oxygen inside the capsule (which was at a pressure of 15 psi or 100 kPa) the fire was quickly out of control. The Apollo 204 Review Board determined that a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the command module pilot's couch had become stripped of its insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of an associated access door. This weak point in the wiring also happened to pass near a junction in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line, which had developed a leak. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the anode made of silver resulted in a violent exothermic reaction that ignited the ethylene glycol mixture, which in turn was able to burn in the atmosphere of pure pressurized oxygen.[1] A similar March 1961 incident had previously claimed the life of Soviet cosmonaut trainee Valentin Bondarenko when the pure oxygen atmosphere in the isolation chamber he had been occupying had caught fire, a calamity the USSR had, for years, concealed from the public. The NASA investigation found that a bar of aluminum can burn like wood in a pure Oxygen atmosphere. It also found substandard wiring in the craft and a missing socket wrench that was ruled out as the fire's cause. Many items on board were flammable, and flammable velcro had been applied to the walls of the craft to secure items in weightless conditions.\n\nThe fire spread quickly and within seconds was an inferno. As a result of toxic smoke and malfunctioning gas masks, ground crew needed five minutes to open the hatch and suppress the flames. The fire had melted the astronauts' space suits and the air lines which connected them to the capsule's life support systems. Grissom's and White's suits were found to have fused together. It was evident from how the corpses lay that they had tried to get out, but they never had a chance. Ed White, who was supposed to open the hatch, was partway out of his harness and had apparently made an effort to escape. The procedure would have had Grissom lower White's headrest, and White proceed to unlatch over 12 bolts to release the hatch. Indeed, even if he were to accomplish that, the internal pressure had risen so high that the inward-opening hatch could not have been opened. Chaffee's job was to begin shutting down the spacecraft and maintain communications with ground control. He was found dead still strapped into his right hand seat. Only 17 seconds from the first call of "Fire!", all three were dead.\n\nIt was later confirmed that the crew had actually died of smoke inhalation rather than burns. According to the Report of the Apollo 204 Review Board — Appendix D Panel 11, (link provided below), Grissom suffered third degree burns on 36% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 60% of his body) and his spacesuit was 70% destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on 40% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 48% of his body) and his spacesuit was 25% destroyed. Chaffee suffered third degree burns on 23% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 29% of his body) and his spacesuit was 15% destroyed.

Non-conformity?\n\nAre you suggesting that chaos is a much better fashion statement than organization (although I firmly believe that chaos itself is an order.)\n\nAlthough I haven't seen the movie, a good friend of mine did and raised this same question to me. My response is now as it was then...\n\nThe major problem that we are facing as earthlings is our seeming inclination to NOT take responsiblity for our own actions. Because of our society's inability to do as such, we are left with one of two choices: 1) Let people do as they please and allow society to become a land of goons and selfish, self-righteous individuals who care not about their society... or 2) Control every facet of life so that people who choose not to make responsible decisions are made to pay...\n\nAgain, brother, the problem is not that people are unable to make their own decisions, it is that people don't appear to be willing to take responsiblity for those decisions, thus leading to other's distress...\n\nI believe, personally, from things that I have learned, encountered, and dealt with in this truly exciting experience that we call "Life," that freedom truly is free if we all assume it. However, people are not all alike and sadly, we are left to the majority of opinion controlling our society. Because of that, there are people who are left dissatisfied. \n\nThis dissatisfaction leads to unrest. Unrest of one, leads to manipulation of more to regain a sense of control to bring about change. From there comes the usage of the most controlling item to balance the scales (in this case MONEY). Once that is achieved, anyone with this sort of controlling factor will want to bring about changes in accordance with what they (and whoever else has assisted them in this monetary augmentation) want. Then you have the ongoing condition of our country soon to follow.\n\nIf you see, the situation went from what is good for the people, to what is good for the persons... \n\nThis, I believe, may have been the thinking behind the development of religious supremacy. If we all believe in one thing and are for one cause, then it is much more likely that we will succeed and progress. If we are all fighting as individuals with unwaivering and unforgiving beliefs, then we will hardly find any success that brings about a true progression. \n\nWhat is most frightening to me, is that it isn't the single belief in a single God or entity that is the key (it may be on a personal level, but is presently impossible at this time in the world on a global scale), it is the simple belief in the human condition and the acceptance and love of all of our earthling inhabitants that will bring about this free society.\n\nThings that are loved and cared for are hardly mistreated. If nothing is mistreated, nothing is offended, and nothing is erased. This is a very simple concept. \n\nIn the end, this sort of ideology does not request conformity, it incites appreciation of all and is ultimately our true road to freedom. \n\nHope that helps...

Ok, first off, uninstall mobile phone tools and lets start from scratch. install the mobile phone tools cd. DO NOT PLUG IN THE USB CABLE OR CONNECT YOUR PHONE! Once the cd is installed, then run "live update". For step by step instructions on how to do that including screen shots, please click here: http://motorola.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/motorola.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=5526\n\nOnce that is complete, connect your usb cable and phone when prompted. \n\nYou should see your phone on the screen, and it should also recognize your phone. There are further technical troubleshooting tips here:\nhttp://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/Motosupport/source/AdvancedMobility_PhoneTools.asp\n\nYou can also call Motorola toll free at 1-866-289-6686 for support should all else fail (please try to call them from a land line or other phone than the RAZR, you will need to be able to connect that to the PC during the call). If all the software is installed properly and it is connected properly, try putting it into another USB port.\n\nIf all that fails, maybe its a bad cable. Contact the place you purchased it from and let them know. Give them a chance to replace the cable.

it isnt gross. in highschool for gym we had to swim and my dumb self didnt wear flip flops and i noticed bout a month later this callous type thing on the bottom of my foot. it kept getting bigger and got to the point where it hurt to walk. well i went to the doctor, and he tried freezing and burning it off never worked. i am bout 90% sure what u have are what u call planter's warts and they are sooo painful. sadly the only way to get rid of them id to go to the doctor, have the doc numb the area and have him dig it out. planter having to do with plant means they have to cut the root out. i guarentee u after the first day u will have a lil soreness, but after that u will feel better. there will be a small scar, but who looks at the bottom of ur foot and there is a slim to none chance of it coming back. i am 27 yrs old and i had it removed at 17 if that tells u anything. if u nd anymore info email me at genler100@yahoo.com. dont be embarrased. its human life. they do suck and are annoying. hope i could help. if u use messenger and wanna chat genler10 not 100 on mess take care.

Artificial Insemination (spelled correctly there) would be your best bet. In AI, you could be the carrier of the baby and have the sperm of your hubby/partner harvested and inserted into you. There is another kind of option in AI wherein both the egg and the sperm is harvested in both partners but a 3rd party will carry the baby if the female egg-donor is incapable of carrying the child herself. \n\nOf course, adoption would be another option.

Get plenty of fresh air and exercise during the day, if you're not physically tired it's much harder to sleep.\nHave a routine, go to bed and get up at the same time each night and morning.\nCut out caffeinated drinks after 6 p.m. Save stimulating activities for earlier on in the day. To feel sleepy you need to wind down so as the evening draws on have a warm bath, afterwards change into night clothes and maybe have a small snack and drink if you need one.\nMake sure your bedroom is comfortably warm and dark. Don't watch T.V. in bed and make sure there is no clutter on the bed.\nReally important - don't drink (alcohol) or smoke in excess before you go to bed. If you do when it wears off you'll wake up and find it really hard to go back to sleep.\nDon't worry too much. If you're fretting about something that can be sorted get up and do it. If you can't, then forget about it til tomorrow.\nIf you use chamomile tea instead of tea/coffee you will feel the difference (more relaxed)

i have not read his book, but i'm sure pretty sure that most anything you want to know about real estate can be found on the internet.\n\nsome things to consider...\n\n--if you had a fool-proof way to make tons of money, would you tell everyone or would you keep it to yourself so you can make more money?\n\n--sheets makes most of his money from selling books and cds, not selling real estate.\n\n--even if you get 100% financing, there is still earnest money, home owners insurance, home inspection fee, taxes, closing costs...\n\n--there really aren't too many "secrets" to flipping houses.\nthe traditional way is to buy low, spend money for minimal repairs, resell it for more money. sometimes you'll see these signs saying they "buy ugly houses and offer cash". they're looking for a house where someone can no longer make the payments but have some equity in it.\n\nthe bottomline is yes you can make money doing this, but you don't need to buy his stuff. do your own research. know your credit, different types of mortgages, and talk to a realtor about your goals.

I'm not exactly sure what you're meaning, but here's two answers.\n\nWith all banks giving credit to YOU, that depends on your FICO score. Your FICO score determines how reliable you are as a lender. Most banks follow the same rates, depending on your FICO score, and all of them charge you similar amounts. \nWith banks loaning to each other, this is called a federal funds rate. Banks actually prefer this over the Federal Discount Rate, which is when the Fed loans money to banks.\nThe Fed requires that banks keep a certain amount of money at all times. This is called a Reserve Requirement. This is checked periodically and is usually a percentage of total checking deposits. To make this requirement, banks will loan to each other, thus satisfying the Fed and each bank.
God never wrote the first edition of the Bible, it was written by man which is why it is full of inaccuracies.
I'm currently in the Air Force stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. You must seriously consider all of your options before you make a decision to enter the military.\n\nFirst off, what are you interested in? I, for example, was interested in computers, so I got into the computer field. I'm actually learning network security which is one of the most interesting things I have ever learned about. My point is, find something that you like doing and see what options the military has for you in that field.\n\nIt's also important to find out what branch of the service you want to go in. The Air Force is known to be a little more relaxed and have jobs that don't require too much stress upon you. We are just as important as any other troop out there, only most of us are safe behind our desks. =P\n\nJust from what you have said, the military sounds like a good option for you, but don't just take my word for it. You say that you want to move around... well, heck... I'm in freakin' Germany right now and I'm having the time of my life! I've traveled to more countries in the past two years than any of my friends have in their entire lives combined. Short on funds? Military pay is known to be pretty weak, but the benefits are endless. They'll pay for college, housing, food, medical, dental... the works. Even if you don't plan on making the military a career, it'll definitely help push you in the right direction.\n\nI hope I helped and good luck to you. If you'd like more information, feel free to contact me via e-mail.

As long as there is no stipulation that the card is non-transferrable, you can try to sell it on ebay. My guess is that you won't get anywhere near the cash value of it because it's insanely rare that anyone gets gift certificates for that large an amount especially on groceries. You will then be further limited to hoping to find a buyer among the people who have access to that particular grocery store or chain.\n\nThere are also a few websites where you can sell gift cards or exchange them for gift cards to other stores and although they were discussed in the news for a while, a great number of people still don't know they exist so again, you'd be hoping for a buyer from a small scross section of people.\n\nWith a certificate that large, in my opinion, the only way you can get the best value out of it is to just use it yourself over time until it runs out.
First, the girl's lawyer will serve you with a copy of the summons and complaint. The complaint will spell out exactly what you are accused of doing, and the relief being sought (most likely money). The summons will explain who you need to send a response to the complaint to (the girl's lawyer), and will tell you how many days (usually 20-30), you have to respond to the complaint.\n\nIf you fail to respond, the court can find you in default, and rule in the favor of the other girl without you being there.\n\nIf you're about to be sued, your best bet is to find an attorney of your own FAST. Then, if the girl's attorney calls you, you just give the name and number of yours, and let them handle it from there.

My heart in hiding\nStirred for a bird, — the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!\n\nBrute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here\nBuckle! and the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion\nTimes told lovelier, more dangerous.

Cool for awhile I suppose, but nothing in comparison (I think!) to the 'hurl and the gliding' of flight. Let's face it, how many of us haven't had dreams about flying?\n\n \nI FLUNG my soul to the air like a falcon flying. \nI said, “Wait on, wait on, while I ride below! \n I shall start a heron soon \n In the marsh beneath the moon— \nA strange white heron rising with silver on its wings, \n Rising and crying \n Wordless, wondrous things; \nThe secret of the stars, of the world’s heart-strings, \n The answer to their woe. \nThen stoop thou upon him, and grip and hold him so!” \n \n My wild soul waited on as falcons hover. \n I beat the reedy fens as I trampled past. \n I heard the mournful loon \n In the marsh beneath the moon. \nAnd then—with feathery thunder—the bird of my desire \n Broke from the cover \n Flashing silver fire. \n High up among the stars I saw his pinions spire. \n The pale clouds gazed aghast \nAs my falcon stoopt upon him, and gript and held him fast. \n \nMy soul dropt through the air—with heavenly plunder?— \nGripping the dazzling bird my dreaming knew? \n Nay! but a piteous freight, \n A dark and heavy weight \nDespoiled of silver plumage, its voice forever stilled,— \n All of the wonder \n Gone that ever filled \nIts guise with glory. Oh, bird that I have killed, \n How brilliantly you flew \nAcross my rapturous vision when first I dreamed of you! \n \n Yet I fling my soul on high with new endeavor, \n And I ride the world below with a joyful mind. \n I shall start a heron soon \n In the marsh beneath the moon— \nA wondrous silver heron its inner darkness fledges! \n I beat forever \n The fens and the sedges. \n The pledge is still the same—for all disastrous pledges, \n All hopes resigned! \nMy soul still flies above me for the quarry it shall find.\n -William Rose Benét, 'The Falconer of God'

"Dragnet" (1954) begins with the actual crime, so that we KNOW who's guilty even before the titles appear.

If you're going on with a masters afterwards anyway, then I'd say the Engineering will serve you better at the undergrad level, regardless of which direction you choose.\n\nI'm just finishing my Ph.D. in Economics. When I was applying to grad schools, I was shocked to learn that the Econ grad programs actually give preference to undergrads with Engineering or Math majors OVER Economics majors. The reason for that is because grad programs in Economics today are heavily math-intensive, and they have observed that Engineering and Math undergrads tend to do better in the Econ programs.\n\nSo, regardless of what you decide to do later, the Engineering major will be better for you.

It's a big risk especially if it's your boss. There will be favoritism and if it shows, your coworkers will be really upset. Just keep it under wraps. If they know you're dating the boss and you get promoted, they'll say it's because you're dating him, not because you're qualified.\n\nPlus, if you break up he might pick at you for little things and unfairly fire you. Or, things could get awkward. Just be professional in the workplace and keep your relationship outside. Don't bring your personal problems with each other or fights in.
The characteristic state or condition of a living organism.\nis the defenition.\n\nI would say it's a series of events, with different emotions and experiances, try to have kids, survive, and die. everyone dies, think of all the living things that have died on this planet sents life began on it. try and hade a good happy life, or a sad evil life. choose your own religion, or not. \n\nMany things can happen to your body after death, rot, mummify, be petrified. I believe that if there is a soul that it is only energy and it is released into the surrounding elements. You make your own hell or heaven here and now. You might be brought back to life through future genetic research, but you would be totally different because of your surroundings.
Theoretically, assuming it was possible, the object would oscillate, with an ever decreasing amplitude, due to the conservation of energy. The man would jump in and fall right through, past the middle and towards the otherside of the earth, but would not 'shoot out' of the otherside, because energy would be used overcoming the frictional forces (air resistance) hence he would oscillate with an ever decreasing amplitude until he is finally stationary, where he/it would stay forever. Such motion would be described as damped harmonic motion.
Sodomize \n1. to engage in sodomy. 2. to force sodomy upon.\n\nSODOMY:\n1. anal or oral sex with member of the same sex. 2. enforced anal or oral sex with member of the opposite sex. 3. BEASTIALITY\n\nTo make a long story short, it's RAPE. And how old are you by the way???
I am one that likes to mind his own business on stuff like that. These things have a way of coming out anyway. Plus if you tell, things have a way of making you look like the bad guy and you are only trying to help.

The Seven Cherokee Clans\nAh-ni-ga-to-ge-wi or Wild Potato Clan - Were known to be farmers and gatherers of the wild potato plants in swamps (hence the name gatogewi = "swamp"), along streams, and swamps to make flour or bread for food, and were so named after them. They are keepers and protectors of the earth. The Wild Potato Clan have also been known as the Bear Clan, Raccoon Clan and even "Blind Savannah" in different regions. The Clan color for the AniGatogewi is Green and their wood is Birch.\n\nAh-ni-gi-lo(la)-hi or Long Hair Clan - This Clan, also known as Twister Clan, Hanging Down Clan or Wind Clan. Gilahi is short for an ancient Gitlvgvnahita, the warrior women's society, meaning something that grows from the back of the neck". Those belonging to this Clan wore their hair in elaborate hairdos, walked in a proud and vain manner twisting their shoulders. They are teachers and keepers of tradition. Peace chiefs usually came from this clan at one time in Cherokee history and wore a white feather robe. The Clan color for the AniGilohi is Yellow and their wood is Beech.\n\nAh-ni-(k)a-wi or Deer Clan - Those belonging to this Clan were the keepers of the deer, deer hunters and trackers, tanners and seamers, as well as keepers of the deer medicines. They were known to be fast runners and foot messengers. The Clan Color for the Ani Kawi is Brown and their wood is Oak.\n\nAh-ni-tsi-sk-wa or Red Tailed Hawk Clan - Those belonging to this Clan (also called the bird clan) were the keepers of the birds, sacred feathers and bird medicines. They were messengers and were very skilled in using blowguns and snares for bird hunting. Their color is Purple, and their wood is Maple.\n\nAh-ni-sa-ho-ni or Blue Holly Clan - Those belonging to this clan were keepers of all children's medicines and caretakers of medicinal herb gardens. They became known for a medicine from a bluish colored plant called a blue holly, and were so named after it. This Clan has also been known as the Panther or Wild Cat Clan, in some regions. Their color is Blue and their wood is Ash.\n\nAh-ni-wo-di or Paint Clan - Those belonging to this Clan made red paint. The tribe's medicine men, Dida:hnvwi:sgi (healers) and Adawehi (wise men), traditionally came from this clan at one time in Cherokee history. The Clan Color for the AniWodi is White and their wood is Locust.\n\nAh-ni-wa-ya or Wolf Clan - The Wolf Clan is the largest clan today and the most prominent clan, providing most of the war chiefs, and warriors. True ah-ni-wa-ya are protectors of the people. The wolf clan are keepers and trackers of the wolf and the only clan who could kill a wolf through special ceremonies and wolf medicines. The Clan color of the AniWaya is Red and their wood is Hickory.

Dear Houyhnhnm,\n\nProbably the best place to start would be to visit most popular program that pay per impression. It is\n\nhttp://adsense.google.com\n\nThis way, you will get paid, for the number of people who see advertisement on your blog, even if nobody clicks on the hyperlink.\nIn my opinion, this could be better solution for you. I saw advertising houses, such as www.valueclick.com dropping their pay-per-click (PPC) programs and switching to a CPM (cost per thousand) or affiliate programs (you will get pay for the actions your visitors take on the advertiser websites, such as: buying products or subscribing to email newsletter). Some affiliate programs, however, do offer pay-per-click, but will automatically switch you to percentage option (you will be paid percentage of revenue your visitors generate) if your conversion rates are low. Affiliate advertisers in the Investing industry pay some of the most generous rates.\n\nThe other website you should consider is: www.blogads.com.\nTheir ads are combination of image and text, and offer some very competitive rates.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nEdvard

To kick the ball high get your foot under the ball and don't follow through when you kick the ball - stop your follow through just after striking the ball. Keep your ankle locked (firm) and strike low down on the ball. \n\nIt takes a lot of practice, so repetition is the key. Try to find a wall and just practice striking the ball against. Overtime you'll have this mastered.\n\nAlso, try to find a training partner, someone who is experienced, and practice with them. Another good tip is to watch good players. There are numerous ways to strike the ball and various techniques. Through watching other players you find the one that works for you.
Computer aided manufacture is described as the interfacin of a computer with a machine tool or process to achieve automated operation. The early form of computer controlled automation was knoon as numerical control (NC) and allowed the control of modified, but otherwise traditional machine tools for metalworking application. The later came the system of Commonly knon as Computer Numerical Control (CNC). With the help of these manufacturing industy has sought to expand production methods that could overcome many of the limitations of mechanised mass production and the inherent standardisation of the goods.
i like ur eyes .. although i cant see them
First of all, do you like any of them. If you do then it might be problematic if the 4 of you dont sit down and discuss whats up. If you dont like them then at some point you will have to tell them how you feel. They certainly have made it obvious to you how they feel. The more important issue is to keep the friendship first; That is what all 4 of you need to look at. Sit down and make sure that the 4 of you understand that at the end of the day you want to be each others best friend. Now there is no guarantee that can happen. What can be said is that by talking it out you know how everyone feels about the situation.

What is dandruff? \nA person's entire body surface continuously sheds dead skin cells. Dandruff , the shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp at an excessive rate, is the result of the normal growing process of the skin cells of the scalp. Dandruff is a bothersome problem sometimes thought to be associated with inefficient hair care. Nothing could be further from the truth - anyone who has dandruff knows that! \nIf you're troubled by dandruff, that snowy, dust-like stuff that falls from scalp to shoulders, you're not alone. Nearly everyone has dandruff to some degree. You can also try out this Anti- Dandruff Shampoo to help control dandruff. \n\nEffects of dandruff \n. Dandruff weakens the roots, and consequently hair starts falling off. \n. Dandruff sticks on to the skin of the scalp in a cake form and blocks free flow of air to the roots. \n. As a result, hair becomes weak at the roots and loosen their hold. \n\nDandruff - Causes \nStudies indicate that 50% of adults are affected by dandruff at some time or the other in their lives. More often than not, it is the result of a disturbance in the body's metabolic process. Your scalp, like the rest of your skin, is constantly renewing and shedding itself. Old cells die out and give way to new ones. And when the natural balance in the metabolic process is upset, the new cells form faster than the old cells can be shed off. These then accumulate on the scalp in the form of flakes. The metabolic process can be disturbed by \n. Drugs \n. The onset of puberty \n. Emotional stress and strain \n. Sudden changes in the climate or your diet. \n. It is also believed that dandruff is caused by a fungal infection of the scalp. \n\nFactors that may augment a dandruff condition\nInfrequent shampooing of hair, inadequate rinsing and excessive use of a hot hair dryer (which also causes contact dermatitis), aggravates dandruff. You could prevent dandruff by shampooing regularly with a mild shampoo. Massage your scalp gently to loosen flakes and rinse the hair and scalp thoroughly. \nExcessive use of hairsprays and gels and improper use of hair coloring products can cause dandruff. Tight fitting hats and scarves should be avoided. \nA combination of cold weather, low humidity and dry indoor heat could explain persistent dandruff. \nPoor diet, food allergies, hormonal imbalances, and infections can all lead to dandruff. \n\nDo you really have dandruff? \nBefore you start treating your hair for dandruff, make sure you really have dandruff. Sometimes a flaky scalp may be caused by too much sun, or excessive use of hair dryers. It can also be caused by the use of soaps on the hair, or harsh shampoos which do not wash out easily. Care must be taken not to confuse simple dandruff with other conditions that also cause flaking of the scalp, such as seborrheic dermatitisor psoriasis. \n\nYour Comb/ Brush and dandruff \nNever use the brush or comb of the person suffering from dandruff as it is dangerous and contagious. Likewise, make sure that you wash your comb/brush after every shampoo if you have dandruff yourself! Many medicines, medicated soaps and shampoos are available to counter dandruff, but the most effective is cleanliness of hair. Brush your hair thrice a day and shampoo at least once a week. While washing your hair, take care the water does not trickle down your face. There are chances that you may get pimples. \n\nSOme home remedies for dandruff \n*Egg pack for dandruff worries \nBeat two eggs and add two tablespoons of water to it. Wet the hair and apply the egg mixture over the hair. Now massage your scalp and let the mixture on for ten minutes to fifteen minutes. Then rinse the hair with lukewarm water. This will keep both dandruff and hairfall problem away from you. \n\n*Tips to get rid of dandruff\nAdd 3 drops of tea tree oil, a natural antiseptic, to a small amount of shampoo and then wash your hair. \nAvoid or decrease your intake of fried foods, dairy products, suga

We know that the equation of a straight line is y=mx+c.Now as the straight passes through (4,-5) ,the value of x=4 and y=-5 would satisfy the equarion.Putting these values in the equation,w get -5=4(-1/2)+c or -5=-2+c => c=-7\nTherefore,the equation is y=-(1/2)x-7 [if you like you may multiply all the terms by 2 to make it 2y=-x-14]

There are four things that make English Germanic.\n\n1) It's sound system is clearly derived from Proto-Germanic through regular sound changes. For example, English hound, German Hund (h:h, n:n, d:t); English tide, German Zeit (t:ts; d:t); etc.\n\n2) It's basic vocabulary is clearly Germanic. For example, (English/German) come/kommen; foot/fuss; five/fünf; etc.\n\n3) It's grammar is clearly Germanic. For example, Early Modern English come/comest/cometh, German komme/kommst/kommt; English "i have made", German "ich habe gemacht" (same perfect construction)\n\n4) It's irregularities are the same irregularities found in the other Germanic languages. For example, English bind/bound, German binden/bund (strong verbs); English man/men, German Mann/Männer (vowel change for plural)\n\nEnglish is absolutely, 100% a Germanic language through regular sound correspondences, the majority of its basic vocabulary, the majority of its grammatical structures, and the same patterns of irregularity
Hey, SCORPIONS are never suited for VIRGO. wanna know why ? You see, VIRGO is ruled by MERCURY and SCORPIO is ruled by MARS. and mercury and mars dont get along with each other. according to indian astrology both are neutral to each other but generally dont give good results, making the person hot tempered. Mercury is friends with SUN and VENUS. so you can tate LEO, TAURUS and LIBRA. \nAvoid CANCER because MERCURY is enemies with MOON and CANCER is ruled by MOON.
Of the 3 natural redheads I know, not one of them had a parent with red hair. I believe it is a recessive gene.\n\nHeres what I found\n\n"One genetics textbook explained it this way: a person with red hair has genes for light colored hair (blond), and also possesses separate genes specifying red hair. This combination makes red hair -- redheads are blonds in disguise!Someone with dark hair might also have the red hair genes, but their dark hair genes overrule the red genes and so they don't have red hair. This would also explain why dark-haired parents can sometimes have redhead children."\n\nI also don't know many true redheads that have redheaded children. Just an FYI\n\nLet it go...love your wife and your child!

It is the smallest (non-zero) number that is a multiple of the denominators. For instance, the LCD of {1/2, 1/4} is 4 because the least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4. Likewise the LCD of {1/2, 1/3} is 6.\n\nBy using this (or any multiple of it) as a denominator, it enables addition, subtraction or comparison of fractions:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4; \n1/2 − 1/3 = 3/6 − 2/6 = 1/6; \n1/3 < 2/5 since 5/15 < 6/15.

Bush, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have committed violations and subversions of the Constitution of the United States of America in an attempt to carry out with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes and deprivations of the civil rights of the people of the United States and other nations, by assuming powers of an imperial executive unaccountable to law and usurping powers of the Congress, the Judiciary and those reserved to the people of the United States, by the following acts:\n\n1) Seizing power to wage wars of aggression in defiance of the U.S. Constitution, the U.N. Charter and the rule of law; carrying out a massive assault on and occupation of Iraq, a country that was not threatening the United States, resulting in the death and maiming of over one hundred thousand Iraqis, and thousands of U.S. G.I.s.\n\n2) Lying to the people of the U.S., to Congress, and to the U.N., providing false and deceptive rationales for war.\n\n3) Authorizing, ordering and condoning direct attacks on civilians, civilian facilities and locations where civilian casualties were unavoidable. \n\n4) Instituting a secret and illegal wiretapping and spying operation against the people of the United States through the National Security Agency.\n\n5) Threatening the independence and sovereignty of Iraq by belligerently changing its government by force and assaulting Iraq in a war of aggression.\n\n6) Authorizing, ordering and condoning assassinations, summary executions, kidnappings, secret and other illegal detentions of individuals, torture and physical and psychological coercion of prisoners to obtain false statements concerning acts and intentions of governments and individuals and violating within the United States, and by authorizing U.S. forces and agents elsewhere, the rights of individuals under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n7) Making, ordering and condoning false statements and propaganda about the conduct of foreign governments and individuals and acts by U.S. government personnel; manipulating the media and foreign governments with false information; concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment concerning acts, intentions and possession, or efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction in order to falsely create a climate of fear and destroy opposition to U.S. wars of aggression and first strike attacks.\n\n8) Violations and subversions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, both a part of the "Supreme Law of the land" under Article VI, paragraph 2, of the Constitution, in an attempt to commit with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes in wars and threats of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq and others and usurping powers of the United Nations and the peoples of its nations by bribery, coercion and other corrupt acts and by rejecting treaties, committing treaty violations, and frustrating compliance with treaties in order to destroy any means by which international law and institutions can prevent, affect, or adjudicate the exercise of U.S. military and economic power against the international community.\n\n9) Acting to strip United Sta

I disagree with you who say they do it for attention. Most of those who do it are very secretive and try to hide the fact that they do it, almost like an addict doing drugs would do. I've experianced a cutter first-hand, and she would just systematically slash parts of her leg that nobody would see. I don't think the method of self-harm has little to do with but more so the ammount of pain it brings, and how easy it is to do to one's self. \n\nSometimes it can be done as a release, or as a "suicidal gesture" in which case it IS usually a last cry for help or attention.\n\nSometimes all a person knows is pain. And I agree with kitty that: it is usually a form of release for them when they are having extreme anxiety, depression or other mental problems.

That depends. Most of the above answers referring to the roots of German and French are quite right--German is closer to English. On the other hand, having learned both languages (French is my second, German my third), I would like to remind you of one thing: the German grammatical system is quite complicated. German nouns can be one of three genders (masc., fem., and neuter), and there are also several cases (ie: genitive, ablative, nominative, accusative). In order to speak any semblance of good German, you have to know the genders of the nouns you are using, and also how these gender decline (ie, how they change when they change case, eg: der changes to den, etc.).\n\nHowever, if you have studied Latin (which also has declensions, etc) then German grammar will be a breeze. Otherwise, if I were you, I'd take French. \n\nGood luck!

I think it's 9 and 11.\n\nIf you take every second number, eg. 7, 3, 13 and 19, you can see that to get from 7 to 3 you minus 4, to get from 3 to 13 you add 10 and to get from 13 to 19 you add four therefore the for the next number you minus 10. So 19 minus 10 equals 9.\nFor the numbers 11, 8, 15 and 18, you minus 3 from 11 to get 8, you add 7 to 8 to get 15 then you add 3 to get 18. For the next one you would have to minus 7. So 18 minus 7 equals 11.\n\nThe sequence would be: 7, 11, 3, 8, 13, 15, 19, 18, 9, 11
Here is your detailed synopsis:\n\nKyle Pratt is a frantic but fiercely intelligent mother whose deepest protective instincts will be triggered by a haunting in-flight nightmare: in the middle of the trans-Atlantic trip, her young daughter turns up missing without a trace. Or does she? Kyle arrives on the flight still reeling from the recent loss of her husband, a woman who has gone mad with grief or a formidably determined mother whose child is in grave danger that threatens the entire plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\n\nStarring: Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby

China's success can be attributed, to an extent, on education (in addition to their low standard of living). Large emphasis was placed on math/science education for retooling their once stagnated, Maoist country into a invigorated, reforming country. The opening of China's markets and workforce is like opening Dutch dikes onto the plains below. The shear capacity for growth was just overwhelming, you're trying to take a country from nothing under Mao to modernity.\n\nYou also have to remember that Mexico is a republic like the US, so any moves the government decides to make are going to be limited in both scope and depth. China, conversely, is authoritarian, so they can ignore what they choose and implement what they want with impunity and overwhelming resources.\n\nI don't think we'll ever see economic growth like China underwent again. Their growth will level off soon enough also.

B.J. was based in rural Georgia and was confronted by a succession of corrupt local sheriffs - Elroy P. Lobo (who was later given his own series, Lobo); Sgt. Wiley of Winslow County and his two fellow lawmen, Sheriffs Cain and Masters. The only honest cop B.J. seemed to encounter was the Fox, who spent much of her time trying to trap the crooked local cops. Tommy was a lady trucker friend and Bullets ran the local hangout, the Country Comfort Truck Stop.In 1981, B.J. settled down to run a trucking business in Los Angeles called Bear Enterprises. His new adversary was Rutherford T. Grant, a corrupt politician who headed the state Special Crimes Action Team. Grant was a silent partner in TransCal, the largest trucking firm in California and stopped at nothing to stomp out potential competition. Because of Grant's intervention, B.J. found it impossible to get regular truck drivers to work for him and had to settle for a crew of 7 young, beautiful lady truckers, including a pair of identical twins and Grant's daughter, Cindy.\n Hello Larry-Following the breakup of his marriage, radio talk-show host Larry Alder moved from Los Angeles to Portland, to get a fresh start. He got a job at a radio station KLOW, where Morgan Winslow became the producer for his phone talk show. Earl was Larry's obese engineer. Lary had been given custody of his two daughters, 13-year old Ruthie and 16-year old Diane. Glib and in total control of the air, he was much less sure of himself at home as the single parent of two maturing girls. Leona, a school teacher and neighbor, tried to bring a little of woman's touch to this chaotic household. Larry's ex-wife Marion ( Shelley Fabares) also turned up occasionally. Added to the regular cast in the fall of were former Harlem Globetrotters basketball star Meadowlark Lemon, playing himself as a owner of a sporting goods store, and Tommy, a 14-year old neighbor. In February 1980 Larry's retired father, Henry, also moved in.\n Yes, you can by them

To have either a sales background or an educational background in the Human Resources field with a concentration in recruitment and retention. You may want to apply for a position at an employment agency as a junior recruiter or a front desk administrative assistant to get your foot in the door, learn the industry and work your way up.\n\n\nRecruiting is a fun and exciting job, if you are built for it. Many people excel while others who excel at other things, arent happy in a position as a recruiter.
Good question actually. A reputable dive shop shouldn't be selling them to a non certified diver. They have a reg similar to that used on a set of normal regs, which require some training on, to be familiar with it's use and limitations. You also need to be familiar with how a compressed gas works on the body and some of the physics involved.\n There are a couple of sizes of spare air, so gas volume will be part of how long a can will last as well as the depth it's used at.\n Mine is the 3 cubic foot (largest I think) and allegedly holds 50 typical breaths when used at the surface. This number goes down substantially when you hit 2 atm and so on. About 25% per atm approximately. I don't think they are what you want, for what you intend on doing. They are refillable, but I don't think the cost is worth it for you overall. Mine's sole purpose is to get me out of a tight spot, should the need arise. Fortunately (knock on wood) I haven't had to take it out of the holster.\n You could get certified for just a little more than the cost of one of these. Just a thought.
The place where the sperm was deposited and the place where urine evacuates the body are in the same region, but it is NOT the same place. The urine is not "rinsing away" the sperm. It is not even touching it.

Liquid Nyquil always makes me feel dopey... but..I'm a lightweight
I'm bisexual myself, and have had serious relationships with both men and women. I've explained to many people in the past the inherent difficulty that bisexuals may have in monogomy. The closest metaphor I have come up with is this...If you had to live the rest of your life and only could have oral relations, and no penetrative relations, would you be able to make due with that? Monogomy for a bisexual is like that...effectively cutting off half of their sexual interest. It can be done, of course...but it's not their 'natural' way of being.\n\nI'm not saying this means that your friend is allowed to cheat on his girlfriend...honesty is the cornerstone of any relationship. But you'd be surprised how many wives/girlfriends are aware of and accept a man who has the need to express their sexuality. How he and his girlfriend make their choices is not really something that you need to expend a lot of energy trying to worry about.\n\nThe main concern I have is that you seem to imply that you and your friend are getting more serious than simply recreational activity. If he is in a relationship and is still seeking another relationship on the side, this goes more to his character than his sexual orientation, and ending the whole thing is a very good idea.

Aruba's currency is the guilder / florin denoted by the letters 'Awg.' but also widely known as 'Afl.' The official rate at which banks accept U.S. dollar banknotes is Awg. 1,77 and checks at Awg. 1,78. The rate of exchange granted by shops and hotels ranges from Awg. 1,75 to Awg. 1,80 per U.S. dollar. U.S. Dollars are widely accepted in Aruba, and banks may exchange other foreign currency.\n\nTraveler's checks are widely accepted and there is no charge for using them in hotels, restaurants and stores. Major credit cards are accepted at most establishments while personal checks are normally not accepted. \n\nThe Aruban florin is divided into 100 cents and there are coins of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, 1 florin (100 cents) as well as the 5 florin coin. The square shaped 50 cent "yotin" coin is probably Aruba's best-known coin. \n\nBanknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 florins. Many souvenirs are made with the square 50 cent coin while the coin itself makes a unique gift for numismatic friends.\n\nCash may be obtained with MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards at credit card offices, banks, in some casinos and via Western Union. ATM cards and credit cards are accepted by ATMs of Aruba Bank, Banco di Caribe, RBTT Bank, and Caribbean Mercantile Bank. The card must have either a Cirrus or Visa Plus logo. ATM instructions are normally given in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento. Cash is normally dispensed in local currency.\n\nTravelers with ATM cards bearing the CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Plus System network logos can withdraw cash in Aruban florins. Home bank accounts will be debited in dollars at a favorable exchange rate, and a 1% - 3% service charge will apply, depending on your credit card company. Before departing for Aruba, it's important to verify whether your PIN number will work in Aruba by calling 1-800-4-CIRRUS\n\nAruba is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone. You didn’t say what time zone you are in (Indiana is in two time zones). If you’re in the Eastern time zone, Aruba is one hour ahead.\n\nPersons planning to visit Aruba as a tourist for a period not exceeding 90 days for the purpose of recreation, sports, health, family reasons, study, religious purposes or business must submit the following documentation:\n\n·A U.S. passport.\n·The necessary documents for returning to the country of origin (valid permanent resident document)\n·Proof of sufficient funds to stay in Aruba;\n·Return or onward ticket and other documents required for the next destination (visa etc.).\n\nNon-compliance with one of the above mentioned documentations might result in refusal of entry to Aruba. The immigration of Aruba based on the funds the tourist is traveling with shall determine the period of stay in Aruba.\n\nTo: Miss Demanda,\n\nHow many people are missing or killed here in the U.S. every year? Should all foreigners stay away from the U.S.? \n\nHere is a quote from an MSNBC news article on Natalee Holloway:\n\nViolent crime is virtually unheard of here. Last year there were two murders, I believe, and those were considered to be drug related and that was it. There were maybe six rapes. When you are talking about an island nation with so many visitors, that is considered an extremely low crime rate.

But K5 means yellow, not blue (somewhat yellower than the sun). Anyway, assuming K5 is correct, and that HD835 is a main-sequence star, and not something weird like a yellowish "red" giant, then it would have an absolute magnitude of around 8, which means it looks like a magnitude 8 star from one parsec distance. But since it appears a magnitude and a half dimmer, that means it's only one-fourth as bright as it would be at one parsec, so it must be twice as far away (inverse square law). So its distance is about two parsecs, which equals 7 light-years.

The song is "Oh, Well" and performed originally by the "early" version of Fleetwood Mac, when they were primarily a British blues outfit. It was written by their guitarist at the time, Peter Greene, who was one of those incredible talents who had some incredible problems. Sometime after Greene left the band, Fleetwood Mac spent some time in America where they picked up Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\n\nThe first studio version of the song goes on for about an hour it seems, and is only good for dropping acid (according to an old hippie I know.) The live version, recorded "Live at the BBC," is the version we most often hear on classic rock radio. \n\nI've heard many covers of this song, and performed it many times on stage, but a version I heard recorded by Kenny Wayne Shepherd a few years ago knocked me outta my seat. Please check it out, if you have the means.
Here's an article from TIME Magazine that should provide some comfort and ideas for you:\n\nWhy Abby Can't Talk\n\nShe has a condition called selective mutism that is neither as rare nor as hopeless as experts believed. But the right help is hard to find. \n\nAbby Barnes' hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy first-graders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make. Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair, Abby, 7, looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer. But every time the teacher calls on her, Abby freezes. Her face tightens. She strains to respond. And even if an answer manages to get past her lips, her words are inaudible. She's effectively mute throughout the school day--even at recess, where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend.\n\nAt home, however, Abby is a different child. She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack, 5. "She speaks loudly--sometimes too loudly--and can be bossy toward her brother," says mother Lisa Barnes, who runs the trading desk at a money-management firm. Abby is, in every other way, a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities, including horseback-riding lessons and dance classes that she's been attending since she was 4. "Performing in public is fine," says her mother. "She likes people to look at her and applaud."\n\nSo why doesn't she speak up in class? What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complex--and much more interesting. Abby, like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U.S., is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism.\n\nThe key to selective mutism, or SM for short, is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits: voluble in private, silent in public. According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-IV, a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM. Experts once believed that fewer than 1 in 1,000 kids developed the disorder, but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1,000, making SM almost twice as common as autism.\n\nSM can strike at any age, even among children who once talked in public, but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4, when peers are happily jabbering away. About 30% of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment, which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause. In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy, but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM.\n\nThe root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia. "It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak," says Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum, a Philadelphia-based clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism. As with most social anxieties, SM is more common in girls and is believed to have a strong genetic component. About 70% of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety.\n\nCompared with childhood disorders in which children are disruptive and disorderly-- such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--selective mutism gets less attention and considerably fewer research dollars. "These children are ignored because, let's face it, they aren't causing anyone trouble. They are literally left alone and forgotten about," says psychologist Lindsey Bergman, associate director of the UCLA child and adolescent OCD [obsessiv

It's really impossible to recommend a bowling ball without seeing you bowl (for instance, what's your typical ball speed?). The best answer is to visit your local pro shop, tell them that you throw a back up ball, and that you're not interested in being trained out of it, but you'd like a new ball. Depending on where you bowl, and how the lanes are oiled, there might be something that the pro shop guy can recommend over the others.\n\nAs for a simple recommendation, any entry level resin ball (The Tornado series from Ebonite; Storm, Brunswick, Columbia each make their own) will give you a simple hook--not a monster hook.

I'm a big believer in having seperate savings and checking accounts in addition to a joint account. I've been married for 21 years and most of our fights were about money. We found very quickly that the best thing to do was put money for household expenses in a joint account, have individual accounts for expenses incurred on our own, and we would put some money in a joint savings account and some in a individual savings. It sounds like we have a lot of money, we don't. We learned to budget very carefully, use credit cards sparingly, and to remember that if one of us spent too much money, the pay-off came out of money that was our own and not to depend on each other to bail each other out. We haven't had a money fight in a long time. It sounds like your husband is on a power trip and you are there to serve him. If you work, you have the absolute right to have your own accounts and to have your own money without having to demean yourself by asking to have money THAT YOU EARNED. If his expenses are incurred by him, for him and had nothing to do with you, your family or your home, they are his and his alone. Good luck, you are in a tough spot.

The first thing, as a female...she's probably incredibly insecure about his, even though it's not her fault. No doubt she misses a healthy sex life, but because you are so important to one another, she's probably feeling a little scared that this is going to ruin one of the greatest things in her life. So while it's important, you have to make sure she knows that it's not AS important as the relationship the two of you have. And don't just say it once, remind her. We girls like to be reassured, because doubt tends to get the better of us. And don't just say it, make sure your actions support what you say. Once she's feeling better about herself, explore a temporary non-vaginal-intercourse alternative to abstinence - by talking about it together, being positive and enthusiastic, and by experimenting, which can be loads of fun for a change of pace. Don't make it about the problem, make it about how fun it can be finding a solution. You may even find that it makes your sex life better in the long-term by having variety there.

I started smoking because I could not sleep/insomnia after I broke up with someone. Since then I smoke everyday and my insomnia gone totally till now. \nThe question now how can I stop my addiction?

I know it is not healthy however, I do enjoy smoking because it gives me certain 'buzz' and calm me down when I am stressed. It also enhance my mood!

It really depends. If you are talking about God, of the Christian aspect, there were NO other humans before he created Adam and Eve. You can interpret the bible that when The great Flood in which Noah made the ark occured, The city of Atlantis could have been indeed sunk underwater. Atlantis having existed doesnt mean that it was around before the first humans because of hypothesis that it was more "advanced". go to www.answersingenesis.org There are many questions answered scientifically with the Bible.

Sex has a number of common meanings:\nSexual activities. \nSexual intercourse - or vaginal intercourse; the physical act related to sexual reproduction. \nA general topic of human or animal behavior. See human sexuality. \nSpecies gender - a biological distinction between two or more categories (sexes), such as male and female, which combine genetic material to reproduce. Some linguists object to this use of the word gender, to avoid confusion with the word's meaning in grammar. \nOther things named Sex or SEX include:\n\nSex is a 1926 play by Mae West. \nSex is a 1991 book by entertainer Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel. \nSex: The Annabel Chong Story is a 1999 documentary film about porn star Annabel Chong. \nSEX was a boutique on Kings Road in the Chelsea district of London. Owned by Malcolm McLaren, it was a seminal location in the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. \nThe "SEX" assembly language mnemonic is often used for the "Sign EXtend" machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other computer architectures. \nSEX is also a good mnemonic for advice about writing essays. It stands for Sentence, Explanation, and eXample. \nSex is an abbreviation for the constellation Sextans.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_%28disa...\n\nSex, in the scope of this article and category, refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction. The somewhat similar term gender has more to do with identity than biology. The concept is confined to organisms that reproduce sexually.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex...

Take some time. they will talk to you, show their emotions, even the little things you do, they admire you. You just have to find time to actually listen to them. Sometimes, when you talk to them and you're comfortable, things just happens on it's own. People reveal their true feelings to you. just give it time. Good luck! =)\n\nsigns:\n\n~look at you, and when you're looking back at them, they turn away.\n~come around and just ask stupid questions that they already have answers for.\n~will do anything just to get your attention.\n~just want to be near you.

Because you are dealing with products not regulated by the FDA (diet pills) the safety and potency should always be questioned.\n\nDiet pills do work, although not forever. You see, diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while. \n\nThey do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.\n\nThere are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first. \n\n1. Genetics - you have very little control, but you are not a prisoner of your genes. \n\n2. Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think, oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder. Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs, bones, fluids and fat. You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly, resistance exercise, and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites (smoking, heavy drinking and drug use)\n\n3. Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.\n\n4. Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.\nMost people are dehydrated and they dont know it.\n\n5. Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.\n\nYou will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source . I cant type it all here, just click the link.\n\nhttp://www.jtfit.com/metabolism/
I feel for you my friend, that does suck very very badly.

Mosquitoes actually use CO2 to home in on a warm blood source. Once close enough they go for the radiant heat. Lucky for them or unlucky for us mammals and particularly human mammals are usually the highest producers of both CO2 and radiant heat in the areas we live.\n\nI and most I know have found "skin so soft" to be the most effective way to repel the mosquitoes.\n\nThe best way to deal with this problem now is much simpler if you normally use your back yard say for a party. There is a mosquito catcher that uses propane gas with a small flame to spread CO2 gas, the burner is quite large and surface temperature is just above the normal radiated temperature of humans so the mosquitoes that do live in your area are attracted to it and the little fan sucks them into a bag.\n\nAfter several uses (days in a row) you will have collected most of the mosquitoes in range of your back yard and things can be so pleasant.
As a Leo, your ruling planet is the Sun. In fact the Sun is not a planet, but truly the centre of our Solar system. As above, so below! You too are a centre of dynamic energy and exhibit the qualities of the Sun in full measure. You are warm, bright and self-aware. Therefore, you want to make an impression in everything you do—in work, in love and in your social life as well.\n\nYou are known for being a show-off, but this is a misconception. Your dramatic flair is part and parcel of your in-built zest for life, love of people and optimistic attitude. Life to you is like a stage on which to perform and express your talents in full measure. In your upbeat state of mind, others are carried away by your positive mental attitude and this is what endears them to you. You enjoy sharing your joys and successes with those you love and when you do, you do so magnanimously without thought of return. \n\nYour loyalty is also another of your trademarks and you give as good, if not better, than you take. In friendship you give your all and expect the same in return. People know you as a genuine friend who is always ready to give a hand. It seems that even if you can’t help someone with their specific problem, you somehow still manage to exude a warm and reassuring vibration that makes them feel better for being with you. \n\nThe downside of Leo is a misplaced pride, a need to “one-up” others and this, in the less evolved Leo, is a warning that whatever pinnacle is reached in life may result in a fall. Humility ought to be cultivated at every step of your path. You will be recognised for your vibrant energy and self-motivated action. You don’t need to big-note yourself to others. People will instantly recognise your abilities and even look up to you. If this adulation begins to go to your head, you must listen to the cautionary advice of a good friend when s/he says, “Step down a notch or two, Leo!” \n\nYou are a born leader and others naturally look up to you for guidance and security. At times you are hard on others and demand the excellence from them that you exhibit in your own actions. People gravitate towards you and you will no doubt be capable of reaching the zenith of whatever path you choose in your life. \n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Leo, study your totem, the Lion. The way in which Leo the Lion rules the jungle, yet at the same time nurtures the young cubs is a perfect description of your Leo strength and domination, blended with tenderness and devotion.

In the U.S., a state court has jurisdiction over disputes which occur in a state. Cases are heard and evidence presented in a trial court, usually located in a courthouse in the county seat.\n\nIf one of the litigants is unsatisfied with the decision of the lower court, the matter may be taken on appeal (but an acquittal in a criminal trial may not be appealed due to the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy). An intermediate appellate court, often called the state court of appeals, will review the decision of the trial court. If still unsatisfied, the litigant can appeal to the highest appellate court in the state, usually called the state supreme court.
I work with somebody who has MS and I am unaware of any special dietary needs she has, other than she can't drink alcohol because of some potential side effects with some of her medications.\n\nI am not aware of any way to try and prevent MS through diet. This would be difficult to proscribe because, as I understand it, doctors are not completely sure what exactly causes MS.

You can go to the emergency room for any reason. It does not have to be a life and death situation. People go to the ER for diarrhea. If you feel you need to be seen by a doctor, and you don't want to or can't wait for an appointment with your primary doctor. Than I would suggest you go, they will see you no matter what your problem is. You just may have to wait alittle while if there are more serious patients than you. And the bill may be alittle more than your primary doctor. But your health and well-being is the most important thing.

This is a really good question. I'd think that they both come from the same root - they have the same origins. Before you can stereotype, you need to know someone's identity. Then you need to apply that identity to other people with the same characteristics. Keeping in mind that not all stereotypes are negative, this is a nice way to link the two.
no im not.. u are!
Negative is ,it is painful to bear.Positive is ,without\nheat u have no rain ,so heat is a must to have water and vegetation,in other wards life itself.

No--we will never see that money again. And we will pay more. BUT--we will not continue with the raising costs of supporting people who are not contributing their full share-and that is a BIG savings.\n We need law and order-not chaos. And right now we do have chaos. States have deficients they can not pay-that are climbing. And one of the big reasons (that we can control) in a mass coming here illegally.\n There has to be a better more "Orderly" way than breaking the law to be here. If you break laws with full knowledge that you were in the wrong don't complain because of consequences. The choices were yours-rather you like the rules or not.\n\nMy choice would be (if given to me);\n Protect the border first and stop adding to the problems. Hold employers accountable. Than work on the rest.\n\nAdd On--I was helping a friend and saw a post\n"I'm as good to a person as people are to me" \n I will remember that. Here on this matter of deportation and on others.
YES!! YOU GUYS ARE JUST GOING THROUGH ROUGH TIMES RIGHT NOW...
If you think back about your relationship, you will probably realize that she was using and abusing you all along. It didn't just happen. Unfortunately, "love is blind", and sometimes we are so caught up in the relationship that we can't see what is really happening. Sometimes we are so infatuated with the other person that we choose to close our eyes to all the hurtful things they do, hoping it will get better. But things will only get worse until we say "enough!" Remember you are of value. It is an honor to be with you, not a right. Expect more respect from the other person. If you truly give unconditional love, then you should expect to get it back.

yes, taking too much of the fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, and K can harm your body. Most of the water soluble vitamins will be taken out of your body by your kidneys. This does not mean that they cannot harm you, only that it takes a large amount of these vitamins to do so.\n\nZinc (like most metals) can give you an upset stomach, nausea and vomiting.\n\nTolerance to vitamins? Not the way you are thinking, but your body can begin to manufacture/convert less of the vitamins it normally does by being overloaded with an abundance of them.
Well.... not exactly. The main part of the country... no but the Islands of Mijorca in the Mediterranian. They are somewhat tropical due to the Mediterranian breezes themselves. On the island, it is mild the year around. Secondly, though NOT ON THE mainland, the Canary Islands(where I have been many times) is tropical year around. They are located off the cost of North Africa. It gets a little chilly from October to March but is still considered tropical.. after all, not too far from the Equator...No, the canary Islands are not tropical in the sense of tropical forests, etc.. The Canary islands are, in actuality, a desert.

No that's physically impossible. In much the same way one could pose the question if we dropped you head first onto a land mine, how far would the sawdust fly? There's no sawdust in yer head, you just don't know anything at all about politics so you resort to personal insults and juvenile humor as a means of advocating your stance on politics, 'cuz ya just don't know any better. That isn't to say you're an idiot, b/c really there isn't enough proof to substantiate that based solely on your lack of education in politics. If one were to check out your Q&A profile they would see that you have a sense of humor, and the capacity to respond intelligently. One could infer that you are stubborn and maybe a little headstrong in your ways, but that doesn't give an accurate or even a complete picture of your personality, or even your intellect, so again we are at a stand-still.

Not all whales are blue. Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) which is the largest animal is blue. \nOther whales have different colors. Few examples are the following:\n>>RIGHT WHALE (Genus Eubalaena) are baleen whales that are black with some white on their chins.\n>>GRAY WHALES (Eschrichtius robustus) is a baleen whale that is gray.\n>>BELUGA WHALE (apterus leucas) is white \n>>BOWHEAD WHALE (Balaena mysticetus) is usually black with a white spot on the lower snout. \n>>HUMPBACK WHALE (Megaptera novaeangliae) come in 4 different color schemes, ranging from white to gray to black to mottled. \n>>MINKE WHALE (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is very dark gray above and lighter below, sometimes with pale trapezoidal stripes behind the flippers on the top.\n>>NARWHAL (Monodon monoceros) is bluish-gray with white blotches .\n>> ORCA (Orcinus orca ) -"The "Killer Whale" is mostly black with distinctive white patches.\n>>SPERM WHALE (Physeter macrocephalus)is usually dark gray to black, but is occasionally light gray.♥

Find a range that rents .... always try before you buy ...Glocks are preferred by law enforcement because of the integrated trigger and grip safety ... in short there isn't really a safety if you grip the gun with your finger on the trigger ....because of this there have been alot of accidental shootings .... Why do you want the weapon.....do you have a need to draw and fire quickly (like a cop on a traffic stop) then yes the Glock .... There were shooting incidents where law enforcement forgot to take the safety off ... that's why the Glock is so popular ..there is not lever or button to press the fire ..just grip & go....\n\nI have the seperate safety ... I hate the accidental discharge potential of a weapon I carry on my person..... I prefer to think before I fire.\n\nBut to each his own......\n\nYou do test drive a car before your buy onw right ..... when you invest the money in something for self defence you should know how it works and handles before you take it home!\n\nHappy Huntin'
Sounds like you have it bad for her. All i can suggest is as long as it is to be a long distance relationship, write her an email every day...... no more than one, unless she responds.... telling her how your day went, how much you miss her, what you miss about her........ it will help. Then find some guys, and go play basketball, or video games....... anything to take your mind off her. OTherwise, talk to her, see how she feels about you...... make sure your both on the same page, for if she is trying to push away, now would be the time to make the break, no matter how painful! good luck!

You might have a hernia. It is pretty common, but only a doctor should make that diagnosis. You may have something completely different, so get it checked out first. \n\nDuring pregnancy, your abdominal muscles "split" and move sideways to accomodate the baby. after pregnancy these muscles are very weak, and may take a while to move back to their proper position. They may even not be able to do their job in keeping your intestines where they belong! (this is a hernia)\n\nYou will need to strengthen these muscles up so they can do their job, some gentle crunches should do the trick, but vigorous exercising can worsten this so take it easy

I have chronic bronchitis, for years, and I know how you feel. I used to take tons of antibiotic with no help. Until.... a doctor has put me on a shot 50/50 of linkasin & depamethrol. It has saved my life. I also have a inhaler that helps tremendous. I drink hot tea or coffee when the coughing is so bad that I thought I would die, and it eases the coughing. But the shot is the trick, ask your doctor about it.If he won't do it, find a doctor that will., because it will save your life. If you smoke, try to cut back or quit, ok? I have cut back so much and feel so much better. So good luck!
Yes, it would be worth it!\nEven if you don't want to advance in your career and are happy where you are, getting your degree is obviously on your mind. It's a goal of yours, and I think you sound like you would be proud of it if you accomplished it. It probably can't hurt anything to go back and work for something if it is important to you. Good luck!

Anti-american he is! And so are billions of other people that are sick and tired of american imperial interventions in their countries. The only threat to america is the current fascists and unthinking robtic reactionaries like yourself that are a real danger. You have been spoon fed a false image of what this country really is. Castro does not nearly have as much blood on his hands as the rulers of this country have. Do you remember the genocide in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (3 million dead). What about Chile and Guatemala? 40,000 and over 200,000 dead respectively. \n\nYour rhetoric on this question exposes your ignorance and i surely would hate to have your ideology and beliefs. You make it seem as if you care about poor people. You said " kill the commie bastard and throw out his regime and insititute a free democracy for those poor people over [there] just 90 miles from USA". Well, the US has been toppling government to supposedly establish democracies. Some examples are Guatemala in 1954 and Iran in 1953. These were democratic goverments the the US toppled. In their place the US installed BRUTAL dictators that make Fidel Castro look like kindergarden Bully! Its as a result of the intervention in Iran in 1953 that today we have the problem we have today with that country, which by my standards has the moral and legal right under international law to defend itself. \n\nI will finish off here with a qoute from Geogre Orwells book 1984.

D\nStanford Univeristy\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA response to RANDY's posting:\n\nRany behind your eloquent words is really a sense od misunderstanding of the whole problem with "terrorism". You are wrong onmany points and i will focus on 2 of them.\n\n1) You stated: "The United States has been attacked multiple times by terrorists with increasing intensity. It is the job of the federal government to ensure that such attacks come to an end."\n\n*You imply here that the US is the victim and that it needs to carry out its wars in Iraq & Afganistan both as a response to 911 (& other attacks) and as a way to prevent such attacks in the future. This is wrong. Attacking other countries will only inflames tensions and create more "terrorism". My claim is back by a CIA report to the Senate Foreign Relations Commitee last year in which the CIA itself has said that the war in Iraq has increased anymosity toward the US & increased the number of terror attack worldwide. In addtion, you have to realize that is was the US that created this problem in the first place. Starting in 1953 with the over throw of DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED Prime Minister Mohamed Mossadegh to install a BRUTAL dictator that killed, raped, and torutred Iranians. ALL IRAINIANS REMEMBER THIS.\nthe way to end terrorism is to get out of Iraq & Afganistan now and stop meedling in other countries affairs! \n\n2) You WRONGFULLY state: "It has proceeded down this path with restraint. While other cultures have a moral foundation that allows, even dictates, targeting civilians, the United States doesn’t."\n\n*Where have you been these last few years?

Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California), better known by his stage name The Rock, is an American actor and former professional wrestler. He has starred in such motion pictures as Be Cool, Walking Tall, The Mummy Returns, The Rundown, The Scorpion King, Doom, and others. He is of multiracial descent, as his father is African-Canadian and mother is Samoan.\n\nJohnson first gained mainstream fame as a standout in the World Wrestling Federation (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment). Before becoming The Rock, he was known as Rocky Maivia, in homage to his father, Rocky Johnson, and his maternal grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia. With this family history, he became the first 3rd generation wrestler in WWE history. Since his entry into acting, Johnson continues to be known simply as The Rock.

Universal brotherhood can only be achieved if individual religions are laid aside. They tend to divide rather than unite people. If we can all agree to covenant to one God, the Creator, it would be the beginning.
You're right, Sweetie. Actually, he has 3 ID's.\nHe is also 'alabamamissy' if you go in and check his answered questions you will see all of the questions asked by her & he did the same thing....asked a question, answered as BrianL and then chose himself as the best answer.\nUnfortunately, some people don't have a life so...\nthey do the best they can at making themselves one.\nThis probably makes him feel very important to ... himself.\nHe is a very sad human being.\n\nBrianL is Alabamaser and Alabamamissy - he unfortunately uses MS as his play point which is very sad and ignorant.\nHe probably has more...but I'm not wasting any more moments of my life on him. He's already threatened to harrass me on all my questions and answers. So probably expect one on here from him.\n\nDon't worry about it, Sweetie. The only thing that bothers me with him doing it is that he has his questions and answers lined up...then when someone else answers to the best of their ability....he calls thems names or tells them how ignorant they are....which just makes him the ignorant one. \n\nIt's not like he's going to win A Million bucks or anything. Think of it this way....he's just wasting three times as much of his life than we are on this silly site. Lol.\n\nBesides...I just went into his open questions and busted him...just for you! \n\n\nLighten up, Sweetie.\nYou must be very young to let such small things bother you.\n\nHave a great weekend...go out and enjoy life and get off of this silly computer!!\n\nBy the way... you make a GREAT detective.

Well, I think that it’s primitive, but you can pray that if you want. It won’t matter. I know that not all Christians think this way, but this is the reason so many people think that Christianity is a angry, hateful religion; it’s always about punishing the “sinners” and people who think differently and rewarding the good Christians. Of course if you are talking about something really bad that the person did (like murder, rape, etc.), then I do think it is normal and healthy to be angry about that. Instead of praying about it, actually do something that will make a difference.
Ethidium bromide (EB) is an intercalating dye extensively used to induce demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (1). Demyelination follows the disappearance of neuroglial cells, chiefly astrocytes, in the early hours of intoxication (2,3). The death of astrocytes makes a breach in the glial-limiting membrane through which Schwann cells invade the CNS and repair the lost myelin sheaths (4,5).\n\nNaked axons receive new myelin sheaths built by invading Schwann cells and remaining oligodendrocytes - the latter along the unaffected living tissue (2). Morphological recognition of the new sheaths is based on the thickness of the sheath and on the presence of a Schwann cell wrapping the axon and surrounded by a basal lamina associated with collagen fibers (1).\n\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) differs from the CNS in fundamental aspects, i.e., histological composition (6) and regenerating capacity (7,8). In addition, Schwann cells are considered extremely industrious (9) and highly resistant to a broad span of spontaneous and experimental injuries (10). The aim of the present study was to observe Schwann cell reaction to local single and multiple EB injections and to document peripheral nerve responses to multiple challenges with the drug in order to validate this intoxication as an experimental model of demyelination in the PNS.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nThirty-four adult Wistar rats of both sexes were maintained in individual polypropylene cages, with free access to ration and water. The rats were divided into five groups and submitted to intraneural EB injections (Table 1). Two animals from each group received an intraneural saline injection. Stance, gait and social behavior were recorded daily.\n\nDemyelination was induced by single or multiple injections of 1 µl of 0.1% EB in 0.15 M saline along 8 mm on the middle third of the left sciatic nerve. The multiple injections were made at 28-day intervals. All injections were made with a Hamilton syringe and the animals were anesthetized with fentanyl/hypnomidate (Johnson & Johnson, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil). The localization of the lesions was facilitated by a stitch in the adjacent semitendinous muscle.\n\nThe rats were sacrificed by an ether overdose and samples of the sciatic nerves were removed. The samples were collected 7 and 15 days after injection from the rats that received a single injection (group 1), and 10 days after injection from the rats submitted to multiple injections.\n\nThe samples were cut into three transverse fragments for light and transmission electron microscopy studies. All samples were washed with PBS, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 48 h, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Semi-thin sections were obtained with a Reichert Super Nova ultramicrotome with glass knives, stained with methylene blue and observed under a Meiji 2000 light microscope. Thin sections were made with diamond knives, stained with uranyl and lead salts and studied under an EM10 Zeiss transmission electron microscope operated at 60-80 kV.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResults \n\nThe rats injected with EB did not show any changes in either stance or gait during the experiment.\n\nThe localization of the lesions was facilitated by the stitch on the adjacent semitendinous muscle although a mild thickening of the epineurium was visible to the naked eye. This thickening was due to collagen proliferation observed in all lesions. Although some variation was detected, most of the lesions were 5-8 mm in length. All lesions showed segmental demyelination and extensive remyelination by Schwann cells.\n\nAfter intraneural injection of EB, Schwann cells showed signs of intoxication with a vacuolated cytoplasm and rejection of the mye

I'm sure it is normal - perhaps to prevent this you should masturbate more often so it doesn't need to come out in your sleep. My boyfriend has only ever had one or two wet dreams in his life, and I think this is because he has always masturbated quite often - like once a day. If he knows we won't be able to have sex on a particular day he will 'take care of himself'. It's healthy and necessary for guys to have a regular 'release' and I think wet dreams are the body's way of releasing that pent up sperm.

Mutations is viral strains are highly exhibited when they are retroviruses such as HIV or the H5N1 strain. Such viruses do not have DNA initially, much simpler for them. An enzyme called Reverse Transcriptase transcribes DNA from RNA when these viruses invade host cells. However, these is a 'stupid' enzyme and it makes mistakes, and for every mistakes it makes, another strain is created due to mutation. For the influenza virus, this is such a trivial phenomenon. It happens almost all the time. But since viruses are relatively much less complicated than eukaryotes, an error usually does not prove fatal. For mammals, there is a smart enzyme called DNA polymerase which transcribes RNA from DNA and the error checking mechanisms are so intricate. \nThe other way can be the kind sort of mentioned by one of the other answerer's. This gene transfer is the so called Horizontal Gene Transfer and it can result in a modified viral strain but I think that is the case mainly for DNA viruses.

When a new object is discovered the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gives it a temporary designation based on the date it was first seen. Thus 2003 UB313 can be decoded to tell you that the data from which the object was discovered was obtained in the second half of October 2003. Next, depending on what the object is, the discoverers propose a certain type of permanent name.\n\nThe planet's temporary name is 2003 UB313. The name "Xena" is frequently heard associated with this planet; this name comes from an internal cod name that we used before we publically announced the existence of the planet. We use these names internally simply because they are easier to say and remember than things like 2003 EL61 or S/2005 (2003 UB313) 1 . There is no chance whatsoever that these will become the permanent names of these objects! As soon as the committees make their decisions these objects will get real names.

The best advice is to pay off as many debtors away as possible and deal with as few of the remaining ones as possible. So if you own 100$ to 10 people, and 400$ to 2 people, pay off the smaller 100$ loans. Then negotiate with the big lenders and give them a stake in your business and try to see who can be your partner. Try to expand your business partners to people who you trust, and don't go to the bank as they will eat you alive with the interest rates that are common place in Africa 20-30%. Seek out venture capital, make a business plan to investors and see if they can take 20% minority stake in your company. Keep good accounts to show that you are serious with your business transparency to outside investors... \n\nThese are just some tips, again the litte information you give it's hard to help. Also a country would be useful, in Ghana I'd tell you to go and see Mr. Donewell Eku at SPEED Ghana, which is an enterprise assistance agency, try to find such an agency in your country that assists Small and Medium Sized businesses.

First you have to be good looking cause it's not the only important thing but it is one of the most important.\n\nThen you habe to be a gentelman, eventhough some girls like ''bad boys'', it's always better when a guy is well manered and polite.\n\nAlso, tou have to be cool, don't act like a stupid around girls\njust be natural and take it easy\n\nLast but not least, have confidance in yourself, show her that you know what you are doing \n\nPS: There is a girl for everyone, I'm sure you ll find one
Hi Gharsha,\n\nMy experience throughout group discussions is that you should demonstrate actively your mentality but with correctness and intelligence. Indeed, being relaxed and confident helps a lot, but not to the point they perceive you may be too comfortable or even arrogant. Yes, perceptions count and often they buy-in the wrong ones! \n\nWhen it comes to a personal interview is easier because you don’t have to compete, only to be honest and give the interviewer as much useful info as you can. Some questions are surprisingly ambiguous, e.g.: “talk me about you”. Don’t panic! You have to follow a coherent line, so sometimes is good for you to require a more specific question –keeping your nice smile-: “Oh, yes…like about how I look at myself? Or about my family? About my past, student experience? About my latest work experience?” Obviously the answers are free, but being a little bit more specific info helps you not to panic (and getting your mind in blank!). \n\nI guess the most difficult part comes when they ask you to talk about “future”. Great businessmen have warned me you’ve just to tell companies what they expect to listen. If you plan to study a master or doctorate in France within 2 years, probably they won’t hire someone who will quit the company in an early future, so don’t say it!!! You dream to work in that company, and you’ll be there the rest of your life working for them –that’s what they expect to listen. Despite the prior, make it clear you’re a person with ambitions and not mediocre –just keep your aces under your sleeves, gotcha?- They hire what they need, and… believe me, when you’re not useful to them anymore, it’d be real strange if they don’t fire you. For me, too, that’s a tough point, but hey, it’s globalization, and nowadays loyalty doesn’t exist at all, likely a multi-national company just buy a little company and then everybody’s out. \n\nAdditionally, is always interesting to ask about the performance, growing, development, career opportunities and: THE GOLDEN RULE: The salary and benefits package, always, always are discussed at the end of interviews or negotiations, don’t even mention it if they don’t touch that issue, wait at the end –when they seem to be so interested on you-. If the company is real good and you really project yourself staying there some time, you can always sacrifice a little money, exchanging it for experience, vitae, training or relationships in order to escalate to better positions-in that company or any other one-.\n\nI hope those tips helped you. Please pardon my English mistakes, but Spanish, Catalan and French really mix my mind up!\n\nGood luck, and tell me if you succeed!\n\nAlfonso

Canara bank is also an option other than SBI. Vijaya Banks also extend vidyarthi loans. Be sure to take the loan only from a public sector bank and not a private one. While applying for a loan, students can include hostel expenses, the cost of books, equipment, and examination fees in the loan amount. Students going abroad can also include airfare. Loan limit. Nationalised banks sanction student loans up to Rs 3-5 lakh. This is higher for studies abroad-for instance, Canara Bank offers loans of up to Rs 10 lakh. \n\n\n* Banks only disburse loans to account holders in the same bank. \n* Loans have to be backed with 100 per cent collateral in the form of immovable property or a mix of securities. \n* Banks may ask for more than 100 per cent collateral, but students are not obliged to give more. \n* The chances of getting a student loan are lower if the parent/guardian is retired and does not have a steady source of income. This is because the bank has to be paid interest during the period of study. The bank could ask for a personal guarantee from a third party. \n* The bank disburses the loan amount directly to the institute a student is admitted in. \n* Students have to provide the bank with mark sheets every semester/ year to show their progress through the course. \n\nMost nationalised banks sanction loans at the branch level, which means that the loan is usually disbursed in about 3-4 weeks. But if there is even a slight deviation from the norm-as defined by the bank -- in the course applied for and the mix of collateral, the loan may have to be cleared at a higher level.\n\nall the best
lol one night me and my pops went fishin out at canyon lake, he was wasted so I drove the boat out to the fishin hole. when we got out there I hooked me a monster of a catfish (weighing 28.5 lbs) and he couldnt hook nothin... for a while at least... first fish he hooked was a bigmouth bass, pulled him off the boat and into the water (he was very inebriated)then he got back in the boat for another go... in which he somehow ended up passed out in his chair... right as he was fallin asleep, he got a pull, it yanked his 200 dollar reel up, smacked him in the face with it, then took off... long story short, gettin drunk with your dad is nowhere near as much fun as watching him make a fool outta himself

I would recommend consulting with an immigration attorney for a full answer, but here's my experience.\nIf you lose your legal status for one reason or another, you can still be eligible for a Legal Permanent Resident status at a later point. As a matter of fact, the applications asks you the question, whether at some point you were "illegal". Things like that happen, and the expired student visa case is not unique. The key to avoiding legal problems is not leaving the country before obtaining the LPR status.\nHowever, when it comes to leaving and then re-entry, you will have some serious problems. Violation of the legal status can lead to anything from a 3-year to a 10-year bar from obtaining a visa. I have also heard from an attorney of a vast number of cases where people were barred from re-entry permanently. Check Ch. 8, CFR. for more details, or the www.uscis.gov website.

i read that article only a few minutes ago and thought the exact same thing. They are comparing the two and they have nothing to do with eachother. Unlike the actress, Mary did not get pregnant because she slept with her boyfriend. I think that article will lead people astray and lead them away from the real gospel. That is what Satan wants...distortion of the truth. The movie, however, looks like a pretty good movie. When I see it though, I may be bugged the whole time thinking about that article. God bless you!\n\nP.S. I am in no way judging the actress here. I'm proud of her for choosing life for her child. I'm only commenting between the comparison between herself and mary that the media has made.
Go with your gut on this one. \nI say it's very inappropriate. Even if this relationship is purely friendship it is definitely crosses some boundrys.

Contrary to popular belief, "only sons," "the last son to carry the family name," and "sole surviving sons" must register for the draft, they can be drafted, and they can serve in combat. However, they may be entitled to a peacetime deferment if there is a military death in the immediate family. \n\nProvisions regarding the survivors of veterans were written into Selective Service law after World War II. Details have varied over the years, but the basic premise remains the same; where a family member has been lost as a result of military service, the remaining family members should be protected insofar as possible.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the provisions are directly related to service-connected deaths. The mere fact that a man is the only child or only son does not qualify him for consideration - he must be the survivor of one who died as a result of military service.\n\nThe present law provides a peacetime exemption for anyone whose parent or sibling was killed in action, died in line of duty, or died later as a result of disease or injury incurred in line of duty while serving in the armed forces of the United States. Also included are those whose parent or sibling is in a captured or missing status as a result of service in the armed forces during any period of time. This is known as the "surviving son or brother" provision. A man does not have to be the only surviving son in order to qualify; if there are four sons in a family and one dies in the line of duty, the remaining three would qualify for surviving son or brother status under the present law.\n\nThe surviving son or brother provision is applicable only in peacetime. It does not apply in time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress.\n\nThe original law, passed in 1948, exempted the sole surviving son of a family where one or more sons or daughters died as a result of military service. No restriction existed at that time to limit the exemption to peacetime. The provision was intended to protect families which had lost a member in World War II.\n\nIn 1964, recognizing that sons of World War II veterans were reaching draft age, Congress changed the law to include the sole surviving son of a family where the father, or one or more sons or daughters, died as a result of military service. At this time the peacetime-only restriction was also added to the law.\n\nA further change was made in 1971, expanding the exemption to any son, not necessarily the sole surviving son, of a family where the father, brother or sister died as a result of military service. This provision was recently expanded to include mothers.\n\n\nMilitary Discharges\nIn addition to peace-time draft deferrment, the Department of Defense authorizes discharges for any son or daughter in a family in which the father or mother or one or more sons or daughters: \n\nHave been killed in action or have died when serving in the U.S. Armed Forces from wounds, accident, or disease.\n\nAre in a captured or missing-in-action status.\n\nHave a permanent 100 percent Service-related disability (including 100 percent mental disability), as determined by the Veterans' Administration or one of the Military Services, and are not gainfully employed because of the disability.\nUnder the provisions of DOD Directive 1315.15, this is a voluntary separation procedure which must be initiated by the service member. It does not apply during times of War or National Emergency declared by Congress.\nIt also does not apply to commissioned officers or warrant officers unless they were involuntarily drafted into the Armed Forces (as there is currently no draft going on, that means commissioned officers and warrant officers cannot be released from service under this provision).\n\nAdditionally, service members who enlist, reenlist, or voluntarily extends his or her active duty period after having been notified of the family casualty on which the surviving status is

In my opinion, your "friend" is just searching for attention, albeit negative. Something must not be right in her life (ie. no father figure in the picture) because she sounds desperate for a "man's" acceptance. Sit her down and tell her how you feel. It's not just her "doing you a favor", she's being self-destructive.

Like browneyedmaiden said, you have to configure each program.\n\nYou can also have programs start automatically by adding the program's shortcut to the Startup folder.\n\nIf you can't find the settings to stop a program from loading on startup, you can stop it in the msconfig menu.\n\n1. Click Start menu\n2. Click Run\n3. Type "msconfig" and click OK\n4. On the popup window, click the Start tab\n5. Uncheck any program that you don't want to start on boot\n6. Click OK\n7. Restart your computer\n\nWhen your computer restarts it will complain about the changes made. However, you can simply ignore this messagae. Just make sure that you know which programs you are setting to not start on boot.

There's a slight difference in preparation depending on whether you will be interviewing at a religiously-affiliated institution, or a non-religiously-affiliated institution. \n\nIn both cases, have questions for the faculty. Here are some appropriate ones:\nDo most students complete the program?\nOf those that do, what do they do afterwards? (In other words, what is this program's placement rate? What are current graduates of the program doing? Do they teach? Where?)\nIs there strong mentoring of students by the faculty in the program?\nAre there language requirements? How are these fulfilled?\nIs the dissertation requirement integrated into the program? How?\nAre most students who are accepted into the program supported? Does this support include full tuition remission? Is there a stipend? \nAre stipends only given to teaching or research assistants?\nIs there a separate method to apply for an assistantship or a fellowship?\nCan non-funded students serve as teaching or research assistants?\n\nIf you are interviewing at a religiously-affiliated institution, you may also have to answer some questions regarding your own religious position or agenda.\n\nIn any PhD program interview, be prepared to talk about your research interests, your theoretical/methodological orientation, and your preparation up to this point (languages, Master's thesis, archaeological fieldwork, etc.). \n\nAlso, it is extremely desirable for you to be knowledgeable about the faculty's respective areas of specialization. Be familiar with each faculty member's current work. If you don't have time to read it all before your interview, at least get familiar with the specific research interests of each person. (You probably know some of this already, since you applied to the program, and hope to have one or two of these people as mentors in your field of specialization.)\n\nBottom line: Look at the interview as an opportunity for a good, productive conversation between you and the faculty. You should see the interview as a place in which to present yourself in the best possible light, but also as a place in which to evaluate the program and its faculty, just as they are evaluating you.\n\nBest wishes!

The best solution for you is to practise meditation.\n\nThe whole aim of meditation is,\n1. to calm your mind, and\n2. to focus the mind on one thing.\n\nFor this you need only a silent place. You could sit on a chair or you could sit on the ground with folded legs.\n\nThe mind of a normal person is like an uncontrolled monkey jumping from one thought to another. To process all these thoughts a lot of body energy is used. Thus if your mind cease to process thoughts you will be saving a lot of body energy which can be used to cure a lot of ailments in your body. That is why a person who continues to meditate regularly even gets a nice body complexion.\n\nAnapana or concentration on the breath is the best form of meditation.\n\nIf you sit down and close your eyes you will notice that your mind is jumping from one thought to another. Even though you want to concentrate on your breath you will find other thoughts also coming in between.\n\nIn learning to meditate you must first learn to calm your mind. You do this by following every thought that comes into you mind. You must be like a Manager of a Hotel who stands at the entrance and observes the customers coming in. Without getting attached to the thoughts try to observe them. You will find that a thought comes in and that it goes nowhere and another thought follows it - try following that too - with same results. This way you will find that your thoughts gradually subside. Do not try to force out your thoughts.\n\nOf course do not expect results in one or two days. Practise it for at least 40 minutes every day for at least 2 months you find that you have 'killed' your train of thoughts. I have practised for nearly 2 years and still vagrant thoughts come in. \n\nThereafter start concentrating on your breath. Notice the breath coming in and going out. You should not concentrate only on the tip of your nose. Notice the breath coming in and thereafter your lungs getting filled and then gradually exhaling the breath. \n\nAfter you finish that for the day start to think of a person or several persons whom you hate most. Having those people in mind start to think in a compassionate manner "may he be healthy, may he be happy, may he go up in life, may he live long". Keep on doing this for about 10 minutes a day for a few months you will find that you do not get angry even when you have to get angry.\n\nYou should be able to get some guidance from the following sites,\n\n1. http://www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm/ \n2. http://www.meditationexpert.com/ and click on the free articles on yoga meditation - it includes articles on all types of meditations including Christian and Muslim meditation.

In addition to the above answer you can also put in more medication without the body rejecting it. For example, you may need penicillion. You could take 2000mgs. by mouth and that's it. The stomach can't take anymore. By I/V you go inject 5000mgs. This is highly important when time is of the essence such as a bacterial infection which is moving rapidly within the body.

I think that you need to talk to your husband. It seems like maybe his accident has made him feel less of a man and having to do something to be able to make love only makes him feel worse. You are going to have to convince him that you still find him desirable and very much want to have a physical relationship with him. I am sure that there are a few things that your doctor can prescribe, but not much point unless you can get your husband in the frame of mind where he wants to. Tell him how much you want him and how good he makes you feel. Hopefully he will respond without having to point out the obvious - that you have needs too.

There are not a lot of people who get paid to play Tennis. The only way to become a professional is to compete in tournaments. Even then, you are not really being paid to play tennis. It's more likely that the fame you win for competing in those tournaments gets your sponsorship deals with companies that sell things to people who play tennis. The short answer is compete in local and regional events until you are good enough to compete at the national and international level. If you are relatively young, plan ahead to attend a college that is known for it's tennis program and talk to the school's athletics association about scholarships.

four and a quart, times 50.\n\nThis equals 50 times 4, plus 50 times a quart.\nThis is 200 plus 50/4\nIntermediate result: 200 + 50/4\n\nHow many times can you take 4 out of 50? 12 times, remainder 2/4\nNext intermediate result: 200+12 + 2/4\n\n1/2 is the same as 2/4, but is the preferred way of writing it down.\n\nresult: 212 1/2\n\n\n\nFor any fraction: (a/b) * (c/d) equals (a*c) / (b*d).\n\nIt is alright to write down 50 as (50/1).\nIt is also alright to write down 4 1/4 as (17/4)\n\nThus: 50 * 4 1/4 equals (50/1) * (17/4) equals (850/4)\nNormalize 850/4 just like I showed above.
If you want to embarrass him, make a big deal out of it. If not, just ignore it. He is 14, this is a normal thing for him. What is wrong with masturbating? Would you rather he be experimenting with girls? For now let him have his privacy. But you might want to have that talk soon. Don't make an issue of it, just say something like, "Hey, son; When I was cleaning your room/gathering clothes (or whatever it was you were doing in his room...) I found some things that make me think we should talk about sex." I told my son that I understand that it is normal for his hormones to be raging out of control at 14 and if he had questions, I preferred he talked to me about it so he could get the straight dope on it. I did not want him learning it on the street where they are not as likely to tell him about AIDS and other STDs. We had serious chats about it and I told him I would be a hypocrite if I told him "DON'T have sex at your age." He is now 20 and is still a virgin. I suspect that won't be for much longer - much to my dismay - but he has a girl that he is talking about marrying. My only baby will soon be out of my home and in his own! 8>(

Difference between standby and off mode:\n\nIn standby, all peripherals are switched off. That means, the modem, LAN card, speakers, hard-disks, other drives... all of these are switched off. The CPU also goes into a 'low power' mode. But it does use some power.\n\nWhen your computer is switched off... Nothing is switched on and it uses 0 Watt of power.\n\nHowever, certain peripherals are also allowed to bring the computer out of standby mode (notably mouse, keyboard, and anything else that you configure in 'device manager' in windows). For such peripherals, even in standby mode they consume certain amount of power.\n\nHope that helps, otherwise, use a watt-meter!

Our heart is myogenic. That is it can beat on its own. If you take out your heart and put it in a solution with the right concentration of sodium, potassium and calcium, it can still beat. This is because, there are a group of cells known as the pacemakers in the SAN,AVN and Purkinjie fibres. They auto depolarise and start an electtrical impulse that travels down a certain pathway so that the 2 atria contracts before the 2 ventricles. \n\nHowever the rate of heart beat is controlled by the medulla of the brain. It either speeds up (sympathetic) or slows down (parasympathetic via vagus and glossopharyngeal) depending on the needs of the body.

some cancers, such as prostate cancer, have a marker in bloodwork. many cancers are not found from simple bloodwork, but from an elevation in certain blood count levels. That tells the doctor's what organs are working or not working. This doesn't mean cancer, just that a system is off. To be sure of cancer, there must be a PET,CT,MRI or biopsy of the suspected organ.

Weaver is a mediocre pitcher. He has been his whole career. He pitched very well in the World Series, and he deserves credit for that. But let's not forget that he was so bad with the Angels early in the season that they designated him for assignment. Weaver is a free agent, and he will command a big salary because there are few pitchers available on the market. IMO, whoever signs Weaver will regret it. He will have his moments, but he is very inconsistent.

Yes, but it is not the most modern one (there is also SPAS 15, 16). SPAS 12 (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun ) is a Semi/Pump action shotgun. Semi is gas operated, which means quicjer reload withouth having to ue your hand to reload, while the pump action..... well, i'm sure you've seen how pump action shotguns are reloaded. For ammo it uses 12 gauge shells. One more thing- this rifles are used in many law enforcement forces all over the world.

Without more details, this is tough to answer. I'm guessing your problem has to do with Outlook since you referenced Office XP. Within Outlook, there is a setting about keeping your email messages on the server. It could be that while you're downloading the mail to your PC, you still have a copy on the server.\n\nTo check this setting,\n\n1. Open Outlook\n2. From the Tools menu, select email accounts\n3. Select View or change existing email accounts\n4. Highlight the account in question and click the Change button\n5. Click the More settings button\n6. Click the Advanced tab\n7. In the Delivery section, there is a checkbox for "Leave a copy of the messages on the server"\n\nIf that is checked, that could be the source of your problem.\n\nYour ISP can also assist you in this and may be able to tell you if they had any issues contributing to the problem.

No -stolen\nYes-lied\nYes-broke your heart\nYes-cheated how do you get even? just forgive? \n\nI personally felt that I never truly got even. She ended up getting the better end of the stick.She made the wrong choices though, and she paid for them in the forms of verbal and physical abuse, but that wasn't due to me. She was booksmart, but dumb as a box of rocks when it came to being Street Smart. \n\nForgive?? No, not at all. When you lose your Best Friend and Girlfriend in the same day, and find out that they have been lying and cheating, and are living a totally different life than of the one you know, then in my opinion, there is no forgiving.
It is really a person decision, but my advice? Stick with OT. I have two more months in my program and then clinicals and I am done. YAY! Why do you find it worthless?

Funny you should say that you hit it like a volleyball, I had this same injury from a volleyball. My diagnonsense,...in simple terms I bruised the bones, pinched a nerve (thus that lovely tingling sensation that will abate after a day or so), and broke a cluster of blood vessels, thus the resulting lump. Do not fear, it will heal, but it will be mildly painful and aggravating for the next week or so depending on how fast you heal,...I found that putting an ace bandage on it worked fairly well to keep me from strainign it. \n\n And as with most things like this, the injury will fade, but the embarrasment seldom does,...hope you had better luck then me and just hurt your arm,...because at the time of my injury I dived for the volleyball and my pants split straight up the back,...hehehe
Organs - Small intestine \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSystem: Digestive\n\nLocation: Abdomen\n\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\n\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\nLongest section of your digestive tract\n\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\n\nChemical digestion\n\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\n\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\n\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\n\nPeristalsis\n\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\n\nAbsorbing nutrients\n\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\n\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\n\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\n\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing.
Yikes that sure sounds like it includes exercise and a lot of it! I'm scared of exercise and sweating.
I have Tuft's, through my employer. It is not very good for me, because I am in Connecicut and they are a Massachusetts-based provider... there is almost no one in my area as a therapist, and the ones that there are really stink. They are good for my prescriptions though.\n\nI have had Oxford and Anthem, and both have been quite good, but also through my employer.\n\nIf you are looking to pick one up privately, I suspect that you will have difficulty because of your condition. The prescriptions can be inexpensive, but because they are maintenance some providers put them on a different pay scale, and make you pay more unless you purchase by mail.

Because hot air holds more water. Hot air also seeks to rise, which pushes down cold air. As it mingles with the cold air, it loses some of its heat. When the air reaches a cool enough temperature for the amount of water it has in it - it rains.

You can play around more in the regular season than in the playoffs. In the Playoffs, you have to play a more complete brand of basketball to win. Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring.

No, philosophy is not a social science. In college it is usually categorized as part of the Humanities and Arts section or department. The difference between philosophy and social science is that philosophy is a belief system based on the use of reason and logic (Metaphysics), while the social sciences are a belief system based on empirical observation to find truth or SCIENCE. Thus, a social science like sociology is based on the actual physical study of society to explain social phenomena, but a philosophy like ethics or existentialism is based on the the use of thought experiments and rational thinking to explain human behavior and society.

You might want to read this, I answered it to a previous question. Oh, and that's great that you are trying out for cheerleading! Good for you!\n\nI'll give you tips for preparing and for tryouts.\n\nBe fit, on time and enthusiastic. Be prepared and alert to follow instructions. As k cheerleaders on the team for tips.\nFind a good gymnastics center in your area, and have skills such as back-hand-springs, aerials, front tucks, back tucks...\nUnless you are really tiny and are going to be a flyer, you need to get some muscle and lift some weights at least 3 times a week. Your going to be lifting PEOPLE and WEIGHT for every stunt. \nHave a solid jump.\nRUN. Fun a few miles every week. Start off at 1/2 a mile and work your way up. You need to train yourself or else you will get exhausted real fast. \nStrengthen your core. 50 sit ups a day will improve jumps and stunting.\nKeep a positive attitude. Always have a smile on your face! \nListen to your captain/instructor.\nDon't be late for ANYTHING.\nPractice 5 times a week.\nBe sure to stretch real good before and after tryouts. Don't attempt moves unless you already know them or have trained for them. It will cause injury and annoy other team mates.
Otto von Guericke performed the Magdeburg experiment. He created the Magdeburg hemispheres, which were a pair of large copper hemispheres precisely cast so that their rims fit tightly together. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the resulting sphere contained the world's first artificial vacuum. \n\nGuericke's most famous performance (the Magdeburg Experiment) was carried out on 8 May 1654 before the Emperor Ferdinand III, and attracted crowds from all over Saxony. Before the emperor and a large crowd, Guericke greased the rims of the two hemispheres and carefully fitted them together. Then the local blacksmith began vigorously pumping the air from inside the sealed copper globe. After a while he was joined by his assistants, as the cranking of the pump gradually became more and more laborious.\n\nThe crowd then watched as a team of eight horses harnessed together was led into the square and attached to one hemisphere of the copper globe. Another team of eight horses was then attached to the other hemisphere. At a signal from Guericke, the two teams of horses strained forward in opposite directions, attempting to pull the two hemispheres apart, but no matter how hard they pulled, the horses could not separate the spheres. Guericke told the crowd that all that was holding the hemispheres together was the pressure of the air surrounding them. The vacuum inside the globe meant there was no opposing pressure to balance this great outer force. They were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nClick on the link below, which shows an illustration of the fantastic experiment.\n\nhttp://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/MAGDEB-S.gif\n\nHope this helps!
persuasive answer against seatbelts? here is something to consider. the average car is designed for a person of at least 5', 6" in height. people under this height are in danger of being decapitated in a violent collison. i am under the height of 5' 6" and i find that wearing a seatbelt that crosses my neck, not my shoulder and chest is very uncomfortable and risky at the least. i have been fortunate to not have had any decapitation in my life (obviously) but i also no longer drive due to a personal accident from a few years back. and yes, i did have a welt on my neck for a while after my accident. hopes this helps in some slight manner, but look up the research and see if i am wrong. my source of information is both personal and from a documentary i saw on the CBC about 2 years ago.

The Green Corn Rebellion took place in 1917 in rural Oklahoma. It was a popular uprising of Native Americans and poor farmers who identified with the Socialist Party. Up until that time, the Socialist Party regularly won 10% of the vote in Oklahoma elections. The short-lived uprising was set off by when the government attempted to enforce the draft instituted by Woodrow Wilson on the farmers and Native Americans. The rebels saw World War I as a rich man's war and resisted violently. The rebellion was brutally put down and the Socialist Party in Oklahoma was effectively destroyed. Nationally, the Socialist Party was blamed for the rebellion, although the incident was set off spontaneously without their knowledge. This was one in a series of events causing the demise of the American socialist movement and it added fuel to the repressive atmosphere of World War I.
OMG, why does everyone in America feel a need to place blame on someone else? For God's sake, it was a bee sting, not a pit bull attack.

Depending on what you intend to do with the colt/filly when the broodmare foals. Breeding is not a science, it is an art or a highly probable degree of expectancy from the results, at best. \n\nChances are, by crossing a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse, you will not get a faster quarter horse. With over two hundred disciplines, many horses carry their traits to their offspring and are bred for a particular reason.\n\nBy crossing the two disciplines, the Quarter Horse and the Tennesssee Walker, you may get a better cutting horse, that may be needed for farming, or a better dressage horse, where appearance weighs a lot in judging or challenging the grand prix circuit with a hunter-jumper, might be an interesting idea.\n\nHowever, the down side of it all is that when you cross breed specific horse disciplines, you may also be inviting a genetic inheritance that could effect the progeny. For example, it has been noted that many bred thoroughbreds from the Bold Ruler blood line carry arthritis into the genetic structure off any foals born of that line. Laminitis, a hoof condition that caused the death of Secretariat, a direct decedent of Bold Ruler, colt-progeny, may also be an inherited trait, doubtful, but a possibility. Only time will afford blood lines genetic structures to be noticed and determined. And, even over time, one negative trait may disappear with the breeding of the progeny to another blood line.\n\nTo make any assumption as to what to expect from any type of breeding, you need to know the intended purpose of an owner of the eventual foal. In essence, the question is thrown back to you as to what do you expect to do with the foal from the breeding of a Tennessee Walker and a Quarter Horse.\n\nIt would be a good idea to check with the equine veterinarian within your community or any college or university to deteremine if the combination of a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse will produce what degree of success. The University of Colorado has an excellent equine breeding curriculum as does Kentucky.\n\nRemember, you must first deteremine your intentions before you breed any specific discipline with any other specific discipline. And, have a knowledgeable veterinarian carry the broodmare to full term.\n\nYou may want to look into artificial insemination and genetic engineering before doing any seriuous cross breeding between the equine disciplines...Good Luck.
Steel is about 7850kg a cubic metre (490lbs a cubic foot). If you can calculate the cross-sectional area of the tubing (i.e. the area of the circle minus the area of the hole in the middle) you can calculate mass-per-length for each size of tubing. Then it's just a matter of adding up the lengths.
No adverse effects, but some precautions are that it should not be used if you have tuberculosis or if you have any infection around the rectal area.

The jewelry repair business is good. There are a number of good jewelry repair schools around the country depending on where you live. Most work on a one week beginners course for basic repair and then more advanced courses for stone setting, etc. You could also make a deal with an existing repair-person to learn from them for little or no pay.\n\nYou can make a living with just repairs. Custom work is more complicated and takes quite a while (a few years) to learn. Most bench jewelers that I know are still learning new techniques even after many years in the business. You need a special dispossion to do this kind of small, intricate work all the time
"Arrogant" is correct. To a great extent, Edison was hyping up DC power against Tesla's AC power because he had a significant financial stake in the matter. By the 1880s, all electrical power was supplied by Edison's companies (today's ConEd). Imagine having so many wires, transformers, and power generating stations around. Even in that era, the cost could amount to billions of dollars. These are what economists call "sunk" costs (you can't recover them).\n\nTesla's idea to use Alternating Current necessitated an entirely different approach. Tesla was working for a competing company, Westinghouse, which had different equipment. \n\nEdison did slow down progress because DC is inherently more inefficient than AC. DC current is just like the current in a battery circuit. It stays constant. But over long distances, the resistance inerent in all wires (even if they conduct electricity very well) causes much of the power to be lost as heat. To recover the lost power output, step-up transformers are required along the pathways.\n\nOn the other hand, with AC current a high-power current in massive wires produces much less resistance that is lost as heat. The only requirement is that the power be "stepped-down" before it arrives at your house.\n\nEdison had some legitimate claims, however. These are:\n\n-AC has the potential to do more bodily damage. The reason is not because AC current is necessarily higher voltage, because two currents of 120 volts, on average, have the same voltage whether they are direct or alternating. But alternating current is only 120 volts on average, it can actually swing much higher since it is produced as a sinusoid (a wave). When we measure the"average" current we take the average of the peaks. That means that an alternating current can temporarily have much higher voltage.\n\n-AC current requires massive step-down transformers, so you can imagine that if you get a "zap" of some of the massive wires carrying high-power electricity from the power generating plants, you're instantly dead. But few of us have the misfortune to ever come into contact with such high-power lines. They mostly pose a problem to maintenance experts who literally sometimes have to arrive by helicopter to service lines.
my computer is very handy. I don't have to go to the computer lab every time i need to use a printer. a refrigerator was handy. And definitely bring a fan. Dorm rooms get very very hot. Also, a desk lamp or clip on lamp is nice, and some sort of shelves. Milk crates work very well. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. There are people coming and going constantly. Halls are almost never empty.

Someday, You can be a proud mom with your son actually in the military. I think it is one of the best things a young man or woman can do as they prepare for life. I remind my soldiers that they need to recognize that the military is one step on the part of life and that it is only part of who they will be in the future. The military teaches discipline and gives confidence to young adults. I once heard that if you could give your children one thing, it shoul be confidence, because with it all else is possible--education, money, love, success. \nThat said, couple confidence with discipline, and you have success. Finally, yes the Army Trucks M915, M916 and HETS have room for him and you.

In the sense that gravity is defined as the force of attraction between two bodies, due to their mass, i.e.\n\nF = gm1m2/d^2..............(1)\n\nit would seem that there are only a few ways in which this force could become negative (i.e. repulsive rather than attractive).\n\n1. If there was a universe where g, the universal gravitational constant, was negative rather than positive (not in our known universe).\n\n2. If ONE of the masses was negative (again, not comprehensible in our universe).\n\n3. If the distance between the masses was imaginary. (again, not evidenced in our universe)\n\nSo, it would seem that anti-gravity would violate our current theories.\n\nIn answer to your question, however, no, I have not experienced anti-gravity with the Levitron. Besides it is NOT anti-gravity. Gravity still opposes the force generated by the Levitron, in balance with it.

Linguists study language and the meaning of words.\n\nOne of the most fascinating classes I took in college was Philosophy of Linguistics thru the school's philosophy dept. \n\nIf you want to really know HOW people think...and really try to get a grasp around language and how it affects thinking and understanding...take a lingustics course. I don't mean "oo" sounds versus "eww" sounds or anything like that. \n\nI mean examining questions like "If an ethnic group has 17 different words for types of snow...does that group look at snow in a different way than a group that has one word for 'snow'."\n\nOr "If a group has no word for 'birthday' or 'birth date', what does that say linguistically about their concept of time and age?" \n\nMaybe this answer is way over the edge..a bit ethereal...or, maybe it will kinda 'click' with someone....

Most schools will accept essays and other homework typed on a computer using a size 12 font with a top and bottom margin of 1 inch and right and left margins of 1/2 of an inch each side. Two pages single spaced using these demensions would average about 1,122 words for the total 2 page document. So one page single spaced would obviously be approximately 561 words. Double spaced one page would equal about 561 words. Of course it all depends on the words you choose to write. If you follow that guide you should be able to type up your hand written essay and then be able to estimate whether you've written too much or not enough. If you use Microsoft Word it will tell you exactly how many words you have typed by clicking on "Tools" in your tool bar. You might want to use that format in case your teacher actually sits down and counts the words in your essay. I have seen it where the teacher has lowered marks if you use a larger font than 12. They know that you are just trying to fill in space with any size larger then 12.\nGood Luck\np.s. everything that I typed above Good Luck equals 198 words.

No. Children's physiology is different from adults and arterial plaqueing does not start to form until the teenage years. It would be like screening the elderly for sexually transmitted diseases...lots of screening with very little result.\n\nThe problem is not that we are not finding heart disease if we are looking, its that there are plenty of people in their 50's and 60's who think that smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and a strong family history are nothing to worry about...and oh yeah, this chest tightness isn't that bad, therefore it must not be anything. On the other hand you have perfectly healthy 20 year olds every day on this forum wondering if that sharp pain in their chest might be a heart attack.\n\nIn sum education would go much, much farther than routine screening for an inappropriate population.

That would be why they call it the theory of global warming

Actually, N has to do with the amount of electrons that the element has. the first level has a maximum of two electroins, so all elements that have under 2 electrons will be in this level (hydrogen has 1 e, He has 2). The 2nd energy level can hold up to 8 electrons, so look at the atomic number (# of electrons and determine which energy level it would be under). N=3, maximum number of electrons is from 9-18)

My doc said within 2 weeks as far as protection goes. I've been using for a year now. But I never go 3 months without bleeding/spotting. The first time I went 6 weeks, then had spotting for a few days. After my first period on it, I went 8 weeks the next time, with spotting for a few days. But its so much better than having a period every 28 days. I love it.

Just read this in my biology book yesterday.\n\nBreaking down alcohol. The liver, the only organ able to break down alcohol in the body, removes the alcohol from the bloodstream by slowly converting in into another poison, acetaldehyde; this poison is responsible for the headaches and nausea ("hangover") that follow alcohol consumption. The acetaldehyde is eventually changed to acetate and "burned" in cellular respiration. Because alcohol remains in the body until it is broken down by the liver, it may take the body hours to rid itself of only a few drinks. Also keep in mind that it mainly depends on your wait. If a person weights 100 pounds and they consume 1 drink = .038% is there blood level, 2 drinks = .075% driving becomes drangerous and you are legally drunk in some states at .08%. Or a person, 160 pounds can drink 2 drinks and have there blood level at .047%, alittle over what a 100 pound person's blood level is at after just 1 drink. So as I said it largely depends on your weight.\nHope this helps!
Only you know what kind of man your husband is, did he feel bad when he was cheating on his first wife with you? Did he have any feelings off remorse?

Believe in your man and have trust in him or that will be the downfall of your marriage. Good Luck

Now see, you have captured some incredible insight here by asking a specific question and giving us introverts whatever time we need to think our answer through. These answers are honest and truthful. And spot-on.\n\nI'll tell you what I have told precious few others what I daydream about. What's odd is I know many others will see this. But you must understand that I am in control at this moment. The introvert is careful and thoughtful. We usually think things through very carefully. After all, what could happen? No one knows who I am. There is no down side.\n\nSo anyway, I write songs about very personal events that have happened to me or experiences I've had. Mostly ballad type songs, mostly associated with my faith. The thing is that I cannot sing a note. I have burlap for vocal chords. But these songs are absolutely my soul and my heart. My daydream is to sing my songs to a captive audience of tens of thousands. Like a football stadium of something. I picture this nearly everyday.\n\nWe introverts are very deep ya know...

Jackie is known all over the world as the author of the bestseller Chasing the Dragon, which tells the story of how she arrived in Hong Kong in 1966 as a missionary and was immediately drawn to the most notorious and dangerous city imaginable: the den of hopelessness and despair that is Kowloon's Walled City. \n\nGod transformed her life and, through her, the face of Hong Kong's drug-gang scene. Applauded for her anti-addiction work by Hong Kong’s government and awarded an honorary doctorate by its university, she was made an MBE by the Queen in 1988
Matter is a tricky thing to conceptualize. What with electron and waves and such. Atoms and electrons aren'y even the smallest particles.\n\nSo imagine this unimaginable small piece of matter, like an atom. In normal space, each partical is nearly infinitly far from another particle in terms of comparatively. In a black hole, that distance ceases to exsist. All matter is jammed up against all other matter past the event horizon. \n\nThen there is the relationship between light, time, gravity, matter, and space. When you factor all that in together, your mind explodes. Seriously, on one on this planet and say they can even begin to understand the full complexity of a black hole and not be lieing. \n\nBut it's fun to think about. It's good exercise for the mind.

To answer you questions one by one - \nJudging from the postings here, most of them. They all know that it was about everything else other than the official mumbo jumbo but refuse to acknowledge it because obviously it would make them seem greedy which doesnt fit to well with their Batman image which the've conjured up for themselves. Strangely enough many believe the fantasy that Iraq is a whooping success story. Forget about the forty odd people who die a day, forget about the fact that the US supported Iraqi government doesnt control an inch of dust outside of its precious greenzone. Some will still harp on about the relationship between Saddam and Al-Qaeda even though its been clearly proven that no such relationship existed. Some will castigate you for believing what they call liberal media propoganda, the voice of the hippies for spelling out the truth before them. If they only knew that they themselves are the subjects of a more vicious propoganda effort by there leaders whom they blindly follow. Others will castigate you in the name of freedom trying to convince you and their own conscience that this is all about dear freedom. In anycase it doesnt matter who's money it is because no serious rebuilding was planned or intended in the first place. Do you really think that they give a damn about the welfare of the Iraqi people. Do you want to know the real reason for this butchery called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Read the second comment. Slowly the truth emerges.

Since this question asked for the political problem DURING WWII, and the rest of the group mainly spoke of AFTER WWII let me take a crack at it. \n\nCharles de Gaulle as the leader of the "FREE FRENCH" sought influence in the decisions and plans regarding the future of France. While the scared and Nazi sympathetic Vichy government practiced appeasement (boy doesn't that sound familiar)the Free French led by the self-appointed De Gaulle meddled in military plans while living in exile in England. The political problem arises from the idea that England is trying to stave off attack and total domination of Europe by Hitler and the Nazis, and Roosevelt is trying to conquer an evil force trying to take over the world. Both do not consider France and other conquered countries to be more than Nazi strongholds now. Counter to the production of the anti-Nazi forces, De Gaulle insists that France will reign again, outside forces will have to go through him to do any planning regarding French soil, and the allies must deliver a regained France to him as leader of the Free French who never were defeated (except that the approx 10k troups had to be lifted by boat to their new home in England.\n\nThe allies should have ignored and thrown de Gaulle out on his ear. He was nothing then, he was nothing as a prime minister, and he died being considered a loser by most.\n\nThis is what happens when you allow an unimportant leader to have say. Too many parallels to today's France.

According to the experts, it's a solid iron ball. That's where we get the Earth's magnetic poles from. (BTW, the magnetic poles have been known to flip--usually about every 130,000 years, but they haven't for about 700,000 years [we're overdue!].) If we didn't have the magnetic poles caused by the Earth's core, the atmosphere would be stripped away, like Mars'. And, without the magnetic field around the Earth, deadly levels of radiation from the sun would fry everything on the planet. Not good.
Hi. I'm going to try to answer this the best I can. I've never heard of nigrogen base analogs: maybe you meant nucleotide base analogs? Typically (especially in HIV) the nucleotide base analogs take the place of a normal base, making the transcription of the virus 'inaccurate' with the mistake in it. This slows down viral replication, and helps inhibit the spread of the virus.

The following Java class HeapSorter encapsulates the functions downheap, buildheap and heapsort. In order to sort an array b, Heapsort is called with the statement HeapSorter.sort(b). \n\npublic class HeapSorter \n{\n private static int[] a;\n private static int n;\n\n public static void sort(int[] a0)\n {\n a=a0;\n n=a.length;\n heapsort();\n }\n\n\n private static void heapsort()\n {\n buildheap();\n while (n>1)\n {\n n--;\n exchange (0, n);\n downheap (0);\n } \n }\n\n\n private static void buildheap()\n {\n for (int v=n/2-1; v>=0; v--)\n downheap (v);\n }\n\n\n private static void downheap(int v)\n {\n int w=2*v+1; // first descendant of v\n while (w<n)\n {\n if (w+1<n) // is there a second descendant?\n if (a[w+1]>a[w]) w++;\n // w is the descendant of v with maximum label\n\n if (a[v]>=a[w]) return; // v has heap property\n // otherwise\n exchange(v, w); // exchange labels of v and w\n v=w; // continue\n w=2*v+1;\n }\n }\n\n\n private static void exchange(int i, int j)\n {\n int t=a[i];\n a[i]=a[j];\n a[j]=t;\n }\n\n} // end class HeapSorter
The following links will take you to downloads of various CD/DVD burning programs, and they're all free. (I'm sure that if you want to take your time and look, you'll find more programs that you could use too.)\n\nOnce you've downloaded whichever program you fancy using, you may need to extract it from a .zip file. (If you're not sure how to do that, send me an email, and I'll talk you through it.) You then double-click on the .exe file to install the program. Some programs will want you to reboot your computer to finalise the installation.\n\nWhen your computer is up and running again, click on Start (bottom left of your desktop) and move your cursor (pointer) over to where it says All Programs. To the right, you will see the name of the program that you've just installed. Click on it. That will start the programme running. You may be asked what type of CD/DVD you wish to burn. Select data DVD.\n\nPlace a blank DVD into your DVD writer (burner), and then you'll need to show the program where the .jpg files are situated on your hard drive. (If you need help with that, let me know which program you've downloaded, and I'll do the same. I can then talk you through what to click on, etc.)\n\nThe easy bit comes next. You click on Burn or Write, whichever the program tells you to do, and sit back. When it's finished writing (burning) the DVD it may automatically eject the draw of your DVD drive. That's it! Before you delete the files from your hard drive, however, it always pays to check that your DVD can be read by your computer, or that of anyone else you propose to share your pictures with.\n\nBest of luck, sir.

A good place to start would be the Shanghai area since you are going there. There are loads of factories around the area: Wenzhou, Zhejiang, Suzhou (there is a huge furniture place there - more than 10 huge malls on one street and you can take more than a couple of days just to view it) etc. \n\nAs for container pricing, it really depends on how much you need....there is a bulk discount if you do it in bulk. All the factories will know how to do it when you talk to them. Now...here is one important tip...everything a chinese manufacturer says is up for negotiations...EVERYTHING. Make sure you get all your tax numbers and export documents sorted out - especially for the UK side. \n\nThe Import/Export business is rather physically demanding here as you need someone around in China to make sure that everything goes smoothly. I am personally not in your line (more textiles) but I think that all exports work the same way. \n\nHope this helps

This is a very interesting question. There are obviously many complicated processes going on in a living creature that can be described as physical and chemical processes, and we are slowly starting to understand them. \n\nHowever, is it possible to produce artificial life by just producing the correct machinery? Or is there something else involved? There is progress being made towards imitating the systems we observe in nature in the laboratory. Will they be alive in the same way? What about more advanced life forms? What is consciousness anyway? Does it come spontaneously with a certain structure or does it take something else?\n\nI do not think anyone really knows yet. However, there are probably strong theological arguments why the actual "life spark" or "consciousness" requires some sort of supernatural intervention. In the next few decades, we will probably get much closer to answering this question.

I think a lot of teens feel pain due to lack of a father. I think a lot of them don't even know what is missing. But a father is very important. \nI know one boy who had a lot of trouble and was in Juvenal Hall and drug rehab. He was telling me one time about the "weird" thing the therapists were saying in group therapy. They were saying that a lot of the boys' problems were related to their fathers. He said to me, "How can my father have anything to do with my problems, when I hardly ever see him?" His mother also thought this was a "weird" idea. I said that it was the fact that his father wasn't involved in his life, but spent most of his time drunk instead, that the therapists thought was harming the son. Not to mention the abusive stepfather. The boy and his mom just couldn't see that this was a problem.\nI agree that some kids handle the situation better than others, and so do some mothers.\nMy own daughter was raised without a father, and I think this had a negative effect on her despite the best I could do for her. I think she was always looking for male affection, and would do anything for a guy. Anything. I feel so sad that she feels there is only one way to get a man's love. By the way, she did pretty well until she was fifteen also. \nBut like you said, everybody's different. \nThe sister of the boy I mentioned, same mother and father, had her problems but determined to have a better life. She's in the Navy now and has a nice boyfriend. She's a very responsible person.

DBGT is the biggest let down in the history of Anime if you ask me. I thought that the next stage after DBZ was going to be this amazing saga of action and unique villains, but instead it turned out to be a really silly series that didn't anything but make loyal DB and DBZ fans hate the new path of the franchise. Its like the whole Matrix syndrome, because you know how bad the last one is, and how the series is going to end it takes the fun out of viewing the first parts. GT tried to one-up DBZ by being over the top, instead it was a piece of animated crap which just wasted artist and developers time, energy, end money.\nPeace.

Unfortunately University of Phoenix gets a bad rap. The truth is the school is Regionally Accredited and has the SAME accredidation as Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University (Along with Yale, Harvard and all your other well knowns). The school is private, tax payers are not funding part of the tuition therefore it can be more costly to attend. Online education is becoming so wide spread, that "brick and mortar" Universities (Arizona State for example) are scrambling to give people the online education that they are desperately seeking. I have personal experience with UOP and really, if you cannot attend school at a ground campus it is a fabulous solution. The only bad experiences I've heard of is people thinking they are ready to get thier degree and they aren't, and now have student loans to pay off. Education is a huge investment, and worth every penny. In a year I should be done with my Masters of Business at University of Phoenix, I recieved my Bachelors at ASU, and because of the convenience of online, I prefer UOP. If you aren't ready or willing to do what it takes to get your degree, you are wasting your time and money no matter where you go.
Two strategies: 1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\n\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live. Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc). Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone? Cancel one. Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!) Eat in. Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\n\n2) list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest. Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off. \n\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line). Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards). "You could lose your house", yes, if you are stupid or not careful. But you can also eliminate debt much quicker! \n\nShop every rate that you have. If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it. You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\n\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings. Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line). High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me.

Believe it or not your parents are looking out for your best interest. As you become older you will realize that your parents weren't trying to control you but just preparing you for your future.

There are no cold packs or ice packs that I know of that are at temperatures above freezing. 36 degrees F is just a few degrees above freezing. The mopst important thing is that you do not freeze the Byetta. You could put the in an insulated constainer with cold packs but make sure there is separation between the medication and the ice packs. You need to inulate the medication so that it does not freeze. Ideally you would get a device that plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car that has a controlled temperature at refridgerator levels. They make them in many shapes and sizes and are getting cheaper. But if you have to use ice and an ice chest just make sure u separate the ice form the medicine to prevent freezing.

That means taxes, insurance, maintainence, saefty of others, compliance with city codes, et cetera.\nYou can rent now and look for a place.\nAlso, if it is a flat: If the property is removed, you may not recieve all opf your money back. With a house, you have a better chance, and, with renting you need to get a new pad.\nyes, the deposit is expensive and yes it can be stressful but no you won't lose everything.
I recommend the east bay near the bart stations. I used to live in El Cerrito and the neighborhood is very nice. The only thing is, that was over 5 years ago, I am sure prices are up, but you should be able to find something reasonable around there. Good luck!

I wish the UN was a joke, on the 4th of July the UN will begin discussion on how to disarm the public (small arms control) The UN already owns vast tracts of the United States via World Heritage cites. UN peace Keepers will be called in domestically in the US while our troops are busy occupying resource rich nations around the world in the event that the governments orchestrates another major terror attack upon US soil.\n\nThats why I am a firm believe of you can have my gun, after you pry it from my cold dead hands.

You're having oral sex therefore you are having sex. It's called oral SEX after all. If you don't want to have sex then don't even do the oral. It seems like a tease to me. You're all hot and bothered and oral is normally the lead into the sex. There is no in between so if you're not ready then don't have oral sex either.

It doesnt mean that a good player can be a good captain. the player should be aggresive for him to make a good captain, like ponting(australia) and smith(south africa), and their performance is proof for this. \nI think one player in the windies team who falls in this category is Chris gayle. I think he is aggresive and the right man in the current squad to lead this depleted windies team.

Batisa by a long shot. LAST TIME I CHECKED THIS WAS WRESTLING. Cena has good skills on the mic and thats it!!!!! If he want to just talk he can stick to his acting career. But leave the wrestling to the real wrestlers. Batista is one of the best in ring athletes the WWE has seen in a long time. Its just a shame he didn't start wrestling at a younger age like Orton.
I don't know the man's name who invented the post-it but I know that he invented it because when he sang in the choir at church he would put pieces of paper to keep his place in the hymnal but the paper would fall out so he decided to invent a "sticky paper". And that is the beginning of the post-it note.
Is that 'Who broke the spell checker' in a northern accent ????
Ok, long answer.\nBasically, I just saw this on T.v. by the way.\nWhen you throw all the big stars on 1 team (Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Kobe, etc), they are all good players, but that doesn't necessarily mean there as good or function as good as a real team. A player can be as good as he wants, but you need teamwork, and teamwork takes a while to develop you see.\n\nThe idea behind the Olympic team is they want to get the whole team as a bunch of young guys (Lebron, Kobe, Wade), so that in 4 years these same guys can play in the Olympics again, therefore building teamwork in the process because they would have played together before you see. They specifically didn't want older players because who knows where these older players will be in 4 years (Iverson, think of any older player, probably will not be on olympic team)
they havent won champions league (YET) but they did win the UEFA cup in 1970. It wasnt the UEFA cup then - 1972 Fairs Cup Renamed as the UEFA Cup.
This very question was the focus of an article in Popular Mechanics about 6 months ago. The glacier in Greenland has been melting twice as fast as it was, only two years ago. The magazine predicted if all the glaciers of the world melted, the result would be a loss of a 100 miles of coastline in from its present location, all over the world. Small islands would disappear altogether. The increase of water has resulted in a slower jet stream and cooler temperatures despite the claim of global warming. In fact, it's the greenhouse gases that are causing the glaciers to melt in the first place.
I'm sure my parents think they have some better ideas of people for me! :)\n\nThose countries where majority of marriages are by choice of the couple have the most broken relationships and lonely people wandering around.\n\nJust thought I'd bring up the other side, stir things up a bit!\n\n\n\nFrom the film "Bride & Prejudice":\n\nDarcy: The groom looks pretty happy. Did his parents force him into it?\n \nLalita: No, he asked his parents to find him a bride, actually. He was busy running his company. He just wanted it to be simple.\n\nDarcy: I see, and so he came here.\n\nLalita: Is that what you think, too, that India is the place to go for a simple woman?\n\nDarcy: No, that's not what I meant.\n \nLalita: Americans think they've got the answers for everything, including marriage.\nPretty arrogant, considering they've got\nthe highest divorce rate in the world!
if you are running windows XP .. first, do a disc clean up and also delete cookies. you should then go to your start button, click on " my computer" then right click on "c" drive then click on "properties" then click on the "tools" tab, then to the error checking section, click on the "check now " button, there will be a box appear with 2 options, " automatically fix file system errors" and " scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors" , select them both!! it may say "it needs exclusive access would you like to scan the next time the computer is restarted?" then click yes and restart your computer.this may take some time to run but it will do it itself and you dont need to be online. its probably just an error on the disc. ....hope this helps

i too am in a rent to own contract and your best bet is to call them and tell them what is going on when u expect money to come in they most likely will charge u a late fee depending on how late u are the rental company that i go through moved the payment back another month witch means i don't have to pay any thing that month just made it were i owned them a month longer then when it should have been paid off
just to say many thanks for putting a post that was very nice of you \nhope you feel better soon and the web sit works

My dear child, i felt this way when i was young. But at the end of the day, you should be proud of yourself and not feel or do it for the sake of others. You should do everything for yourself. Don't feel that you owe others to make yourself feel good. You are responsible for how you feel. Don't worry so much about the future. Once you have taken care of your present, your good future will follow. Take care.

You have it right when you talk of your own self, but when you talk of nations and other people, well this is the kind of stuff and attitude that has build a bad reputation for the US of A. I think if one looks at the mass number of humanity on earth and the percentage that hates your country, I wouldn't be surprised if you are one of the most hated countries in the world.\n\nRemember, the US became great only because it had a huge gene pool, people from all walks, nations races came to or were brought to your country, and the genetic exchange resulted in great minds that made your country the greatest in it's time. Also you were fortunate that WWII and global political shifts resulted in a number of brilliant minds migrating to your country-Einstein, just to name one.\n\nEven today, I think maybe 1 in 2 brains in Silicon valley is Asian, predominantly Indian, their brains have helped your country become what it is.\n\n\nWith greatness comes responsibility.\nI'd suggest - Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you, and an eye for an eye will blind the whole world.\n\nAs a citizen of a country that is numero uno in the world, I think you need change in attitude, as do many of your fellow citizens!\n\nst

There are a couple ways to send an IM from Yahoo IM. The first is to click on the button with the talk bubble with the exclamation point in it. Then you click on the other contact tab and enter the person's ID that you want to talk to. The other way is to talk to them if they are already added onto your buddy list. In that case, all you need to do is to right click on the person that you want to talk to and click send an instant message. Hope that helps.

This is not a complete analysis, and I am not an expert in this area, and just the result of a few random thoughts. You can flesh this out as needed. \n\n\nLet f(n,x)=the nth application of function g to x. In your case g(x)=sin(x). In general, a function g(x) will have some values x at which f(n,x) converges to a fixed point, and some values x at which it does not, but diverges, or exhibits periodic or chaotic behavior (wanders around in some bounded region). \n\nFor the case of g(x)=sin(x), \n\nf(1e1,1)=.463\nf(1e2,1)=.1689\nf(1e3,1)=.0546\nf(1e4,1)=.0173\nf(1e5,1)=.0055\nf(1e6,1)=.0017\n\nPlotting log(f(1en,1)) versus n shows an approximately straight line, so that if a0=-1.1274 and a1=0.4303, then y(n)=a0*n+a1 is a reasonable approximation for log(f(1en,1)), and log(f(1en,1))-y(n) is \n\n(-0.0729, 0.0460, 0.0441, 0.0222, 0.0036, -0.0431) \n\nfor n=1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively. \n\nI notice that there appears to be some oscillatory behavior in this residual, which you might be able to model fairly accurately as well for more variance reduction in your convergence prediction. \n\nMaybe this will get you started and you can dig into this further, depending on how much depth you need.

Thermal insulation of a building refers to the walls, windows, and doors (anything exposed to the outside elements and atmosphere), and their ability to restrict the passage of heat from the inside out or outside in. All materials are measured in terms of R value, or thermal resistance. When calculating the amount of heat allowed to transmit through a wall, window, door, or other building component, the formula to use is Q=UA(Toutside - Tinside) where\n\nQ= the amount of heat transfered expressed in Btus/hr\nU=thermal conductance of building component that the heat is trying to pass through, also U = 1/R\nA= surface area of wall that makes up that component\nToutside = outside air temperature\nTinside = inside air temperature\n\nEach different type of material or component has different abilities to restrict the flow of heat. Mainly it is due to the amount of air within the component (air within a building wall is a bad transmitter). What insulation trys to do is break up the wall into numerous small air pockets. Heat has to first raise the temperature of the first pocket before it can heat up the pocket next to it. This occurs over and over until there is not enough heat to keep heating up air pockets. Fiberglass insulation has millions of these air pockets and therefor makes a great insulator. Stone (brick) or metal on the other hand has none so after you heat up the material, the heat then can begin to heat up the next thing to it, probably the atmosphere.\n\nSo a material with a high R value restricts the flow of heat more than that of one that has a low R value. Window, since they are normally made up of one or two panels of glass typically are the highest point of heat loss/gain within a structure. The worst types are the ones constructed of just a single pane of glass. More high efficient ones are made of glass that has a greater propensity to heat up, and also have a vacum between two panes of glass. \n\nThere are many types of thermal insulating products available. See the attached website for a short list. Mainly the walls are constructed with rolled-insulation (R-19 where the number denotes the R value) up to R-38 rolled-in insulation. There are sprayed-in the wall cavity insulations where the R-value can be as high as 48. \n\nThe main type of insulation is not just the insulation, but the type of construction of the wall. Wall constructed of plywood over 2x4's with rolled in insulation have a lower thermal insulating value than those with Brick over plywood over 2x6's since you can put more insulation within the 2x6 cavity. As you can see, the type of wall is also very important.
A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping from it except through quantum tunneling behavior. The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word "black." The term "black hole" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return. Theoretically, black holes can have any size, from microscopic to near the size of the observable universe.\nBlack holes are predicted by general relativity. According to classical general relativity, neither matter nor information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer. For example, one cannot bring out any of its mass, or receive a reflection back by shining a light source such as a flashlight, or retrieve any information about the material that has entered the black hole. Quantum mechanical effects may allow matter and energy to radiate from black holes; however, it is thought that the nature of the radiation does not depend on what has fallen into the black hole in the past. (orionquest13)Show proof that black holes have been reclassified as worm holes if you can.

did you know you can actually make glue from milk? The first step of the process is adding the vinegar to the milk, which will cause the milk to seaprate into solid curds and watery whey. What's happening here? Well, the vinegar is causing the proteins within the milk to bind together, forming the curds. The substance left over is that watery whey protein. This of course is a chemical reaction because the substance (milk) is converted into a substance with different composition and properties (curds and whey).\n\nFor further reference, contact little Miss Muffet.\n\nHope that helps!!

I couldn't tell you. I figured that at my age that I'd have it all figured out too. I started college late. I have a degree. I ended up with a crappy job, and am now job hunting again. The last job was not very fulfilling. I just know that things are going to work out. There are things that are out of my control, but there are things that are. I just focus on those things. It'll eventually work itself out. The only real successful people that I know struggled years before making it big. They just did a few things to make it happen. 1) Never took no for an answer. 2) Believed that anything could happen. 3) Never gave up on their dreams/goals. 4) Just had faith. Especially in their selves. I just believe that something will happen as long as I don't give up.

I do. I think it is all a part of God's plan for us. To learn how to deal, and to cope. To learn from mistakes, and feel the whole emotional realm. Just life I suppose. I try to roll with it, but sometimes I hit some pretty hard bumps! Oh yeah, I'll marry you :)
God bless.\n\nWith love and prayers in Christ.
I love my husband because we have been married for 17 years. In this day, 17 days is good and 17 months is a miracle. 17 years is unheard of. We have great respect for each other and sometimes when I don't want his advice and it makes me mad, I still listen and vice versa. We have learned we may both think differently, but we respect the others thoughts.
Mr. Mister had it almost right!\n\nHe said\n>No. She is not a virgin anymore.\n\n>She was single and gave birth to Jesus. after >the birth, her and Joseph got married and had >kids.\n\n>Jesus does have 1/2 brothers. 1/2 sisters as >we know them. Thats right.\n\nActually, Joseph did marry Mary and they went to pay taxes in another town called Bethlehem. That is where Jesus was born. After Jesus was born the Bible clearly tells us that Mary had other children. People do not realize it is there, because it is not a religious point that ministers preach on, and most people do not read their own Bibles! However, it stated that she had other children. \n\nShe was not a virgin after Jesus, but she was a virgin when Jesus was born. However, to give her that title is not really wrong, but an acknowledgment and declaration of her being a virgin at the time of Jesus birth.
Shangri-la is an imaginary land depicted in the novel Lost Horizon (1933) by James Hilton.\nA remote beautiful, imaginary place where life approaches perfection: utopia.\nMy definition of utopia is a place without violence, or fear, no one is hungry, no one has worries, everyone is happy, healthy, and we all live in harmony.

There is no indication that he committed the unpardonable sin, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 12:32). \n\nHe did, no doubt, viloate the third commandment, as do all leaders who are implementors of commercial Christianity. His choice of the 25th of December was probably more deliberate because he was a son worshiper. That is the date Nynus (Tammuz) the sun god, the alleged son of Nimrod, was born. His motives were probably political even though he had the "vision" of the shields with crosses on them and the message was "in this sign conquer".

Despite the resistance, insurance companies are finding they must turn to new, unexplored avenues for cost reduction. \n\nThe industry has not made an underwriting profit in almost a decade. Up until recently, insurers were able to survive -- and in many cases do quite well -- because they made up losses through investment and asset management income. But 2001 proved to be a turning point. \n\nLast year was one of the most dismal underwriting years ever, and the asset management side of the insurance business began to falter due to the sinking stock market and volatility in the credit markets. \n\nMoreover, there was increased competitive pressure on insurance firms from financial services companies. \n\nInsurers are, of course, embracing all the prescribed measures for tough times, such as tighter underwriting requirements and participation in industry e-commerce endeavors. \n\nNevertheless, industry watchers and participants are witnessing a distinct movement toward CRM in the insurance sector as a novel way to beat the odds. \n\n"An insurance company is always interested in avoiding loss, whether that loss is paid out through settlements or through excessive administrative overhead," Aberdeen Group research director Denis Pombriant told CRMDaily.

OK little'un. From a parent who "trusts" a kid online.\n\nThe ONLY way a caring parent will trust you online with blogs or IM .. or myspace is if they have the tools to easilly monitor what you are doing online.\n\nIt is NOT just a matter of trust, it is a matter of SAFETY to a parent who cares. I know that a parent who cares is a real PAIN .. but you should be thankful, many kids don't have a parent who cares one iota.\n\nThere are many tools out there, some are low cost or free, the better ones cost a some bucks. One of these tools, once they are loaded on your computer, keep track of EVERYTHING you do on your computer. Your parent can come in at their leisure (even online from work in some cases) to check what emails you have sent or received, view complete conversations that you have held online, view EVERY web site you visit. Some of these tools even allow the parent to set time limits on your internet access. (yes, Johnny, the web is addicting, IM is addicting and you can waste your entire life before you know it on the WWW)\n\nI know this is not the most exciting thing for a youngster to contemplate, having a parent know EVERYTHING you are doing online.... but .. for a parent who cares .. it may well be the ONLY way they will allow you to get online and experience the whole universe of the web ... safely.\n\nAs long as you are careful, only enguage in proper conversations, NEVER give ANY personal information over the internet that could identify you. Your parent will be happy with your web access .. including IM.\n\nI had used a product called I AM BIG BROTHER several years ago .. I know there are much better products out there now. A web search should quickly turn up a dozen or so parental monitoring tools that your parent might accept.\n\nGood luck.

Let me state a few facts that may be unclear or distorted by the false image the media creates; Islam as a religion doesn't approve of killing innocent ppl, regardless of their color, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, etc....\n\nArabs or those living in countries that speak Arabic can be non-muslims as well, like in many countries I've been to for e.g. Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria, & Jordan there are many Christinans who belong to diff. sects, & there are still a minority of Jews living there cos it's their home.\n\nTo answer your question, I think that violence will help solve nothing, it will breed more hatered & distruction regardless of it being unorganized like the WTC attacks or organized like the invation of Iraq where also thausands of innovent Christian & Muslim Iraqis died since it began.\n\nI hope i helped....May tom. be a better day

Because we are stronger mentally, we don't have tunnel vision, we are adaptable, we are emotional, we can cry, we are usually the one doing everything possible to work it out, we are willing to talk, scream, get emotional, we do call these things talking it out by the way.

I think Iran's desire along with it's radical goverment is a serious and alot more of a threat to a total middle east breakout than Iraq ever was! I don't think Israel along with the United States will stand by and let this continue.

Try stimulating yourself during intercourse. You will get yours and your man will be incredibly turned on from watching you. The best position for this is you lying on your back and him between your legs, kind of like missionary, but on his knees. If you aren't comfortable with him watching at first, do it doggy style and just reach back there (this is also a great way to stroke his scrotum, just the touch will drive him crazy.) Some women just can't orgasm without clitoral stimulation and there is nothing wrong with doing WHATEVER it takes to get yours!!

Okay Archive means it is archiving the email from the INBOX..\n\nTo take advantage of Google Search, and reduce the time you spend organizing your inbox, archive your conversations. Archived messages and conversations are stored in All Mail, and are available when you search your account.\n\nSo when you check the option ARCHIVE, it goes to ALL MAIL.\n\nArchive is usefull if you have Labels. If you label your messages it is a total mess having your inbox with 10000 messages. ALL Mail does that. Inbox is what you have incomming , recieving.\n\nSo when you finished reading a message, apply a label to it, and then archive it to be hidden from INBOX. And it will be shown in the label.\n\nSo if you want it to be shown in INBOX again, goto ALL MAIL and select the option MOVE TO inbox.\n\nThats it

Cotton fiber (once processed to remove seeds and traces of wax, protein, etc.) consists of nearly pure cellulose, a natural polymer. Cotton production is very efficient, in the sense that, ten percent or less of the weight is lost in subsequent processing to convert the raw cotton bolls into pure fiber. The cellulose is arranged in a way that gives cotton fibers a high degree of strength, durability, and absorbency. Each fibre is made up of twenty to thirty layers of cellulose coiled in a neat series of natural springs. When the cotton boll (seed case) is opened the fibres dry into flat, twisted, ribbon-like shapes and become kinked together and interlocked. This interlocked form is ideal for spinning into a fine yarn.

The Gulf Stream is right. I've sailed across it several times. It's like a river in the ocean. There's a line where the water color suddenly changes to a deep electric blue and the water temperature goes up to 80 some degrees. Benjamin Franklin was the first to make a useable chart of it.

Try to chat to him, talk to him, maybe even date him. You can never decide whither the person is good or bad by the look, beauty... Try to just talk to him or have lunch together to see who he is, and then you could decide wither you love him or not, and he will decide who he likes more, you or your friend.\nGood luck! Hope you get it going with him!

There was a program on the Animal Channel about a baby walrous that was abandond by his mother, and was rescued and brought to the zoo. Humans were taking care of him, and teaching him the walrous ways. He was sooo cute. He was a huge creature that just wanted to cuddle, and could have killed his handlers if he cuddled too much, but it was heartbreaking to see how he just wanted to be with others. \nThen they intorduced him to a few grown walruses. The first time he met one of them he was just so joyful and playful and cute... I love walrues ever since I saw that program. Wish I had become a marine biologist.

Well let's see:\n\nOil Shale:\nPositives- Can extract a large amount of petroleum products from a source that is largely untapped.\nNegatives: The process is time consuming and requires the use of fossil fuels.\n\nEthanol:\nPositives: Burns more cleanly and isn't derived from a nonrenewable source.\nNegatives: There is not enough plant matter out there to satisfy all energy needs.\n\nCoal:\nPositives: With new clean coal technology, coal can satisfy much of the energy needs while polluting less.\nNegatives: Still dirty, still nonrenewable, and still dangerous to mine.\n\nNuclear:\nPositives: "Clean" since it does not technically produce ozone-depleting gases; fuel has the potential to provide nearly unlimited energy.\nNegatives: Nuclear waste is an environmental and political nightmare; most nuclear plants are not highly profitable given the cost of fuel, maintenance, safety and other considerations.\n\nSolar:\nPositives: Very clean, renewable and unlimited.\nNegatives: Equipment expense makes it cost-proibitive- for now. Solar plants generally do not generate sufficient power for large metropolitan areas.\n\nWind:\nPositives: Very clean and renewable.\nNegatives: Equipment, as with solar power, is expensive.\n\nHydroelectric:\nPositives: Clean and renewable. Can generate significant amount of power.\nNegatives: There aren't enough huge rivers, like the Colorado, Amazon, and Nile, to power a hydroelectric plant of large scale everywhere. Very costly.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells:\nPositives: Efficient and very clean- end product is water- and renewable. Has portability.\nNegatives: You must expend the same energy making the hydrogen (as from a hydrocarbon molecule) as you get out of it. Net: no energy gain. Usually fossil fuels are required to process hydrogen. Hydrogen is not readily available. Cost prohibitive for mass market as of now.\n\n\nTaken individually, neither one of these alternatives will replace our energy needs. One of the biggest problems which typical renewable energy sources have had (such as wind, solar, hydroelectric) is that they are not portable. That is, you can't simply strap on a huge solar panel to your car and start it up. While it is true that batteries can be recharged with energy from wind, solar, or hydroelectric, the conventional batteries we have today- the lead-acid types we see in cars- do not provide sufficient power (even if you add a bunch of them in series) for trips of long duration.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells solve the problem of portability and power: all you really need is a source of hydrogen. That hydrogen can be condensed so that there is a sufficient supply to last several hundred miles (researchers are working on improving this). But hydrogen itself is not readily available. In fact, we have very little of it on earth because it all tends to float up into outer space.(it being the lightest gas).\n\nOne way to solve this is to take a hydrocarbon molecule- such as methane- and remove the hydrogen. But removing the hydrogen requires energy. So even though hydrogen and oxygen combine in a fuel cell to yield energy, that energy is about the same as that required to displace the hydrogen from a hydrocarbon. So why would anyone want to have fuel cells if the net energy gain is zero?\n\nWell, because of that portability issue again. Say we have a solar, wind, hydroelectric, or even nuclear plant that produces electricity. While that electricity is not portable, we can use it to power up a hydrogen-generating power plant. We, in effect, transfer the energy from a renewable source into hydrogen, which we can then use at hydrogen "gas" stations. \n\nSome environmentalists claim that because hydrogen necessitates a hydrocarbon source, we're still using the nonrenewable hydrocarbons we were using with petrol. They further claim that this makes the whole process non-clean. These claims are valid only in the sense that today we are, indeed, using nonrenewable fuel

Dreams are a form of subconscious stress relief. You are either worried that he could some day cheat or leave you, or as much as you feel that you wouldn't cheat on him, you have a hidden wild side that hasn't been explored. You might need to get that out of your system before you can become truly satisfied in a committed relationship. Make sense?

Get up early when the day is fresh and walk for at least a half hour, walk as fast as is comfortable. Breathe in the fresh air, exhale negativity. You wouldn't worry so much about what people are thinking of you, if you knew how little they did! So, just do it! When you sit there thinking of reasons why you can't exercise, you are sabatoging yourself. Take the first step - out the door. Go Girl!!!
Hi Kat\n\nYou must cleanse your system. It doesnt matter what disease of symtom you have. The blood must be cleansed or you will always have issues. Crohns disease was never actually cured because the toxins in the colon are still there. When we dont have regular bowel movements (30 min after we eat), the toxins sit in the colon and get into the blood and that is what causes illness and disease. You must do a colon and liver cleanse to jump start your health back to normal. Here are some more tips on Crohns. \n\nCauses\nCrohn's disease can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor diet and nutrition, food allergies, imbalanced levels of hydrochloric acid, impaired immunity, infections, lack of exercise, "leaky gut" syndrome, pharmaceutical drugs, and stress.\n\nNote:\nPharmaceutical Drugs: The following drugs can all cause and exacerbate various gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn's disease: Accutane, Alka-Seltzer Antacid and Alka-Seltzer Pain Reliever, Anturane, Genuine Bayer Aspirin, Bayer Plus Aspirin, Bayer Regular Strength Enteric Aspirin, Bufferin Analgesic Tablets and Caplets, Ceptaz, Clinoril, Cuprimine, Ecotrin Enteric Coated Aspirin, Feldene, Ilosone, Lamprene, Leukine for IV Infusion, Lopid, Marplan, Meclomen, Novantrone, Paraplatin, Piroxicam, Prokine I.V. Infusion, Retrovir, Rynatuss, Supprelin Injection, Suprax, Ticlid, Tolectin, Toradol IM Injection, Trecator-SC, Trilisate, and Voltaren.\n\nQuick Action Plan for Crohn's Disease \n\n\n1. Diet is of primary importance. Avoid all sugars, refined flour products, and carbohydrates, milk and dairy products, processed foods that contain preservatives and artificial sweeteners, alcohol, hydrogenated and trans-fatty oils, as well as foods that are common allergens.\n\n2. Emphasize organic, fresh vegetables and non-citrus fruits, organic grains, as well as organic, free-range meats and poultry and wild-caught fish.\n\n3. Drink plenty of pure, filtered water throughout the day. Gallon a day if you can.\n\n4. Enema containing butyric acid two to five times a week. (Add one tablespoon of butyric acid to one quart of warm water.) Do a Colon Cleanse to clean out the toxins in the body. A liver cleanse will help new blood penetrate the sick areas and help the healing process.\n\n5. Supplements with vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc, taken with a multivitamin/multimineral formula. Essential fatty acids, especial omega-3 oils, are also recommended.\n\n6. Stress reduction through the use of various mind/body medicine techniques, such as biofeedback, hypnotherapy, meditation and relaxation exercises.\n\n7. If you smoke, stop and if you are currently taking aspirin or other NSAIDs, consider replacing them with safer, more effective natural remedies.\n\n8. Soothing baths two to five nights and alternating hot and cold water packs placed over the stomach and upper abdomen.\n\n9. Juice remedies include aloe juice; wheatgrass juice; cabbage, papaya, and carrot juice; and carrot, beet, and cucumber juice.\n\n10. Juice of half a lemon with warm water, especially in the morning.\n\nEducate yourself on the above ideas and your life will change. Email me with any questions you have.\n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers

Reverse thrust is the temporary diversion of a jet engine's output so that the exhaust gases are blown forwards rather than backwards. The resulting thrust force acts against the forward travel of the aircraft.\n\nA shield is moved in place behind the engine which diverts the thrust forward.

My mom (i do too) just drinks vegetable juices (you need juicer machine) 2x daily and avoids meats, milk & milk products, table salt, sugar, etc. and just eats natural foods (fruits included). Under normal conditions her bp is under control (unless she gets upset, of course, etc.) Vegetable juice drink will include the basic mixture -- carrots, cucumber, apple (only fruit can be added for added sweetness), celery. Sometimes you can add fresh spinach to the mix. Green leafy veggies, kale, broccoli (all parts), etc. can be added too. I suggest get the organic ones if you can.
Not quite sure what you are asking, but when matter is accelerated, it gains mass. The faster you go, the more massive you become. Finally, at c, your mass becomes infinite. Obviously, this is not possible, which is why lightspeed is not the sort of barrier that can be broken, like the sound barrier.
People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.

You've just answered your own question by putting a comma after the exclamation mark in Yahoo!.\n\nIf you need to put a comma after the exclamation mark, why don't you need to put a full stop? If you think you don't need to add a full stop after Yahoo!, then would you ask a question with Yahoo! at the end of it without the question mark?\n\nNow, having a company name with a period at the end would be really confusing.
Since you're a beginner and not interested in self defense I would recommend the Ruger MKII or MKIII for a variety of reasons.\n\n1.) It takes .22 LR rounds which are extremely cheap. Approximately $90 for 2500 rounds in the U.S.\n\n2.) It has low recoil which is good for a novice.\n\n3.) It has safety features that are not found on other guns. Such as not allowing the gun to go off when the magazine has been removed; an internal locking device; and a round chambered indicator. Which is good for a novice.\n\n4) It's an accurate gun good for competition shooting.\n\n5.) It has adjustable sights which is good for competition shooting.\n\n6.) It already comes which a weaver style mount so you can mount a scope on it if you'd like. Which is good for competition shooting.\n\n7.) This gun is affordable anywhere from $229-310\n\nReviews for the Ruger MKII: \n\nhttp://www.chuckhawks.com/dktaylor.htm\nhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/shooter2_indy/mk2.html\n\nReviews for the MK III\n\nhttp://www.gunblast.com/Ruger_MarkIII-Hunter.htm\n\n\nSo in conclusion I think that the Ruger MK II or MK III would make a good target gun for a novice shooter.

I live in Ohio and I'm a smoker. I believe that in certain cases it is fine to not allow smoking, like in office buildings and court houses and the like. I also believe that the owner of the property should be able to decide whether or not he wants to allow smoking. As in privately owned restaurants and bars. These places may be public in the sense that anyone off the street can go in there and sit down and have a meal/drink. However, its like listening to bad music, if you don't like it, don't listen. If you don't like that people are smoking in a certain restaurant, don't go there. It's called choice and the fact that some people don't smoke or don't want to be around smoke shouldn't limit the number of places smokers can go and enjoy a meal or drink and be able to have a cigarette when finished. Also, it is ridiculous to make people stay fifty feet or whatever from the entrance to a building. Outside there are many other carcinogens in the air besides smoke that people breathe in every minute of every day. Not to mention that being outside in itself takes away the second-hand smoke factor.
People are just responding to this situation negatively because that is what they were taught growing up. Don't worry about it. Just stand by your man and be happy you found someone to love and that loves you back. Pretty soon the world will be all mixed anyway! Good Luck!
First of all, know the serieses allotted to different service providers such as BSNL, Air Tel etc. They have specific numbers. with this half of the number can be remembered easily. and for balance say the number rythemically or whether the number can be fitted in even or odd series. and finally remember the total of the number. For example 9826883422 can be remembered like 9+8+2+6+8+8+3+4+2+2=52 5+2=7. Like this.

redish/orange\n\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun. A terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet", as the two are very similar in size and bulk composition.\n\nVenus has an atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen, with a pressure at the surface about 90 times that of Earth (a pressure equivalent to a depth of 1 kilometer under Earth's oceans); its atmosphere is also roughly 90 times more massive than ours. This enormously CO2-rich atmosphere results in a strong greenhouse effect that raises the surface temperature more than 400 °C (750 °F) with temperatures at the surface reaching extremes as great as 500 °C (930 °F) in low elevation regions near the planet's equator. This makes Venus's surface hotter than Mercury's, even though Venus is nearly twice as distant from the Sun and only receives 25% of the solar irradiance (2613.9 W/m² in the upper atmosphere, and just 1071.1 W/m² at the surface). Owing to the thermal inertia and convection of its dense atmosphere, the temperature does not vary significantly between the night and day sides of Venus, despite its extremely slow rotation. Upper atmosphere winds circling the planet approximately every 4 Earth-days help distribute the heat to other areas on the surface.\n\nThe solar irradiance is so much lower at the surface of Venus because the planet's thick cloud cover reflects the majority of the sunlight back into space. This prevents most of the sunlight from ever heating the surface. Venus's bolometric albedo is approximately 60%, and its visual light albedo is even greater. Thus, despite being closer to the Sun than Earth, the surface of Venus is not as well heated and even less well lit by the Sun. In the absence of any greenhouse effect, the temperature at the surface of Venus would be quite similar to Earth. A common conceptual misunderstanding regarding Venus is the mistaken belief that its thick cloud cover traps heat, as the opposite is actually true. The cloud cover keeps the planet much cooler than it would be otherwise. The immense quantity of CO2 in the atmosphere is what traps the heat by the greenhouse mechanism.\nSize comparison of terrestrial planets (left to right): Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\nEnlarge\nSize comparison of terrestrial planets (left to right): Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n\nThere are strong 300 km/h (200 mph) winds at the cloud tops, but winds at the surface are very slow, no more than a few miles per hour. However, owing to the high density of the atmosphere at Venus's surface, even such slow winds exert a significant amount of force against obstructions. The clouds are mainly composed of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets and cover the planet completely, obscuring any surface details from the human eye. The temperature at the tops of these clouds is approximately −45 °C (−50 °F). The mean surface temperature of Venus, as given by NASA, is 864 °F (464 °C). The minimal value of the temperature, listed in the table, refers to cloud tops —the surface temperature is never below 400 °C (750 °F). (This makes the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.)\n\nThe atmosphere also contains hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrogen sulfide reacts with sulfur dioxide, which implies that some process must be creating these components. It is unclear how the carbonyl sulfide could be formed--it is often a sign of biological activity. Some have suggested that microbes exist in the clouds (which also contain droplets of water), and produce these components from water, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide.

Unfortunately, kids can be jerks, and bullies. A lot of people get picked on, and you need to just ignore them, and do not give them the gratification of knowing that it bothers you. If they don't think it bothers you, they will quit in time.\nYou can try to soften your look a little, and maybe dress an little more "girly," which may help, but I don't think that you need to, unless you really want to. You don't want to go around changing the real you, based on what some dumb kids say.

Bartter's syndrome involves a group of symptoms and signs:\n\n * Enlargement of certain kidney cells\n * Alkalosis associated with reduced potassium (hypokalemic alkalosis)\n * Increased production of the hormone aldosterone (see the aldosterone test)\n\nThere is no elevation of blood pressure with Bartter's syndrome, which usually occurs with kidney disease. Batters syndrome is also known as Potassium wasting. \n\nThe exact cause of Bartter's syndrome is not known. In some cases, it may be genetic and the condition is present from before birth (congenital).\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a defect in the kidney's ability to reabsorb potassium. As a result, an excessive amount of potassium is excreted from the body.

Yes, it was enlisted personnel who did it. Not necessarily "lower echelon" enlisted (a Staff Sergeant is already serving time), but enlisted.\n\nI do not believe ANY commander would ORDER his people to do that. I have spent far too long in the military than to know better than that. But I certainly do believe their command knew about it and condoned it.

No you do not NEED an agent but it might be in your best interest to have one. You are buying a new home. The development most likely has their own selling agent. If you go in without an agent you are only a customer to them. The other agent is not looking out for your interests but his sellers. It is up to you on whether you want one or not but I would recommend it if you have never purchased a new home so you have someone looking out for your interests.

I didn't take the time to read what the other people have written, so excuse me if I repeat anything that has already been said...\n\nYou have touched on the essential points. There are so many children out there born to parents who can't or won't take care of them. Is it fair to force that on a child? If the mother is wise enough to recognize that she cannot properly care for a child, then kudos to her.\n\nAlso, many a mother has had to drop out of school, work two low paying part-time jobs, and basically give in to a crappy life for her and a life in daycare for her child because she is struggling to care for her child and make ends meet. Let women choose to finish school and get a decent job before trying to bring a child into this world that they must support.\n\nAnd to all the people who disagree, how many unwanted children have they adopted? how many hours do they spend mentoring children in foster care or in children's homes abandoned by their parents? I would bet none of them has ever seen a child in foster care, not to mention helping any of them. \n\nThe only demand in adoption is for healthy, white, newborn babies that come from healthy, educated parents. There are thousands on wonderful children in foster care hoping for a home of their own. Let's get all them adopted before we force more children to be brought into this world destined for the same fate!\n\nI will stop rambling now, but yes, it should be a choice that all women have a right to. \n\nOh yeah, and don't get me started on the fathers...how many dead beat dads are out there? Just because the father decided today that he wants a baby doesn't mean he will be there emotionally or financially in the future. It should be the mother's choice because the child will be her life long responsibility...
I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I think you are looking for the dates at which various animal groups (including humans) evolved?\n\nThe oldest fossils of Homo sapiens sapiens come from the Klasies river mouth in South Africa, and are dated to about 100,000 years ago. From there, modern humans spread out to reach all around the globe.\n\nThe earliest member of the genus Homo was Homo habilis (aka 'handy man'). This was the first hominid definitively linked with stone tool manufacture and use. The earliest finds are in east Africa (Kenya, Tanzania) and are about 1 million years old.\n\nThe earliest hominids are the Australopithecines, such as Australopithecus afarensis. One of the most famous is the skeleton known as 'Lucy'. Also found in the region of east Africa, the earliest fossils date to about 3.5 million years ago. Fossil trackways such as the Laetoli footprints take this date back to perhaps 5 or 6 million years ago, and there is some other evidence that they may have evolved 9 or 10 million years ago.\n\nThe earliest primates are Late Cretaceous in age, about 65 million years old (about the same time the dinosaurs went extinct).\n\nThe earliest mammals are known from the Triassic (about the same time the first dinosaurs evolved) about 210 million years ago.\n\nThe first reptiles appeared about 310 million years ago.\n\nThe first amphibians emerged on land about 360 million years ago.\n\nThe first fishes show up about 520 million years ago, and the very first chordates during the Cambrian explosion about 570 million years ago.\n\nThe Earth itself is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old.\n\nAll of these dates have been arrived at through scientific radiometric dating techniques, as well as stratigraphic corellation.

You can say that. If the truth were to come out, women, for the most part, are a pain the the as*s for the military establishment. In administrative rolls, they do fine and are extremely efficient. As combatants they are high maintenance and unreliable. Oh, there are exceptions to that rule, but watch the eyes glaze over on any platoon sergeant when you announce to him that he will have women in his platoon.\nUnfortunately for the military, it has become the dumping ground for every politically correct or set aside program adopted by the government. It has no choice but to do as the dumb as*s politicians want because the spineless generals still don't know how to stand up to as*sholes like Donald Rumsfeld.\nI often wonder what the outcome would have been if Rumsfeld tried to push his meely mouthed agenda on someone like George Patton. It's my guess that they would both have to go to the hospital, to get Patton's boot out of Rumsfeld's as*s.

It's not just females. More than half of all people (male and female) will have an STD at some point in their lifetime. Each year, one in four teens (M and f) contracts an STD.

All I can say is get tested for STDs if you or your partner have had other partners.

its the amount if pins on the processor, thus a 754 wont fit into a 939 or visa versa.\n754 was the first mainstream amd64 socket. the max cpu that will be made for it is the 3700amd64. it is going to now be the budget line so it wont be developed a whole lot further as for as mainboard features. it does not feature dual channel memory.\nskt939 is the current enduser socket. processor speeds are going beyond dual core 4800+ processors so there is a definate upgrade path. it can handle dual channel memory. the motheboards have features like the nf4 chipset including SLI, pci-express, better sata options, and more. since better chips/chipsets are being manufactured on 939 it is also perferred for overclockers and \nThe major difference between S754 and S939 is that S939 processors have a 128-bit memory controller and the S754 has a 64-bit memory controller. In other words, dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it, from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI, PCI-E, etc), those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards, simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money.

.\nRock containing halite as its main constituent.\nCoarsely ground or granulated common salt.\n\nThe noun rock salt has one meaning:\n\nMeaning #1: naturally occurring crystalline sodium chloride\n Synonym: halite\n\n\nRock Salt (With a Deadly Weapon) \nRock Salt (With a Deadly Weapon)is a Halifax rap group comprised of Auggie Hayes and Matt Houlihan. They first collaborated in April 2005, on their first song Magic Card Kid.\n\nThey are now close to completing their first album titled The Bassment Sessions. It features such songs as Busch, Saunders Park, and Glucose Solids where they rhyme about their experiences in the West End of Halifax.\n\nThe group now has quite a large cult following in West End Halifax. Collaborations with other rappers such as Father Rhyme are on their way.\n( http://www.answers.com/rock+salt&r=67 )\n\n\n\nMake Salt Crystals \n \n \n \nIntroduction: \nCrystals look and seem to be very valuable. However, did you know that you can make them right in your own home. This project will help you to make your own salt crystals.\nWith few instructions and materials, you can make sparkling salt crystals in your home.\n \n \n \n Material and step by step instructions: \nSalt is one of the materials that can form crystals. Crystallization is also a method of separation and purification of salt. You can use rock salt to make clear and pure salt crystals. \n\nFormation and growth of crystals is a slow process. Formation of large salt crystals takes weeks or even months; however, small crystals can be formed in just a few days. In this project you may make different crystals and use them as a part of your display. In your report write what conditions makes a larger crystal. \nYou may also use salt crystals to construct varieties of different decorative objects. The picture on the right show two different candle lamps made of crystals.\n \n \n \nDetails of this project\nMore details or support on this project is available for the members of ScienceProject.com. You may also be able to find good books about it in your local library. \n( http://www.scienceproject.com/projects/intro/primary/PX015.asp )

Leave Ryan alone. You want him to show all those other girls that you are superior. You are a shallow person for this. You really do have a crush on Robert, and should try buttering him up a little. Stay friends with Shara and stop gushing all over Ryan- everyone can tell you are a punk. Take Shara out for dinner, or invite her over for a slumber party. Don't ignore Ryan- treat him as you treat Shara.\nGood Luck and don't try to be superior- it gives everyone a better view of your rear end.

Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results. Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format. It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.
Depending upon the underlying cause, there could be several things you could try. One is limiting the amount of fluid intake before bedtime, another is establishing a pattern of using the bathroom right before bedtime regularly.\n\nIn some cases, the child may be a very sound sleeper and they make some devices that can be used to sound an alarm at signs of moisture.\n\nPossible causes to this problem could be physiological, such as slow development or some type of blockage of the nerves that sense a full bladder, although sometimes the cause can be psychological too, caused by a major change in a child's life. (Such as moving to a new home, switching schools, divorce or death in the family, etc.)\n\nIf limiting fluids and establishing a pattern don't seem to work, you should consult the family physician for further guidance.

Before doing it at your wedding, he really should have come up to you both for permission. That way you could have figured out how you could make the announcement in a way that would still make it your day, but rejoice in love and committment in the room. You could have arranged them to do the asking in private and announce it at the end of the reception in a very nice way. He was out of line, but on the other hand your wedding is now special since you were a part of the history of another marriage. He did a thoughtless thing, but didn't he mean well? Did he really do it to steal your limelight, or was he just clueless and meant well?\n\nIf you really want to make announcement at his wedding, why not ask if there would be a way to do so without detracting from their big day. If you just want to do it out of spite, I would argue against it, especially if they didn't propose to spite you. It is never a good thing to do the wrong thing, even if you think you were wronged. \nThe fantasy of revenge rare holds up in reality. \n\nYou can choose to hold a grudge, or let it go and just be happy that they felt comfortable enough to share their joy on your day (ie. spin it to something positive). Life is too damn short.

Yes, without a doubt. Disney is got to be one of the safest parks. People die on the rides, but the law of averages says that it is going to happen.

Nanotechnology comprises technological developments on the nanometer scale, usually 0.1 to 100 nm. (One nanometer equals one thousandth of a micrometre or one millionth of a millimetre.) The term has sometimes been applied to microscopic technology. \nNanotechnology is any technology which exploits phenomena and structures that can only occur at the nanometer scale, which is the scale of single atoms and small molecules. The following are the applications: \ncancer treatments that reallywork, clean energy, clear water, a restored environment, the key tospace exploration, future jobs, and new manufacturing capabilities. Nanosize" powder particles (a few nanometres in diameter, also called nano-particles) are potentially important in ceramics, powder metallurgy, the achievement of uniform nanoporosity, and similar applications.

Websites? I don't know. It never is that great an idea to do research at the last minute (though it happens). If your paper is not due tomorrow then you should visit the library tomorrow and check out the National Geographic collection. You'll be sure to find some helpful stuff there. A lot of libraries have websites though. Check your local library website and see if they have a 'research' link. You'll need your library card for it though, so they can verify you're a resident of library district. Perhaps the website for the Monterray Aquarium (in california) would have some info too. Or maybe the aquarium in Seward Alaska. They probably have websites too.

A drug is anything besides food that alters the way your body runs. A medicine is a type of drug designed to help you in a certain way (fighting off disease for example).

***I agree.***\nOr they can not listen, if they wish.\n\nThe reason why they complain is because Jesus message is the TRUTH and the TRUTH is a painful medicine to take if your a sinner. \n\nThey hear the word of God and it stirs something inside their hearts, something so powerful that it angers them. If they repent their sins, and give it over to the Lord Jesus Christ, they will replace that anger, sin and hate with LOVE, JOY and FORGIVENESS. \n\nThey will be filled with the loving gift of the Holy spirit and they will be given the awsome gift of salvation. They will be free to spend an eternity in heaven by accepting Jesus Christ.

Both are racists, spouting extreme views and both should have been convicted.\n\nThe difference? Rahman is an extremist nutter, who talks shite and nobody actually listens to. He is wrong to say what he said and deserved jail, but since no-one took him seriously, he posed no threat and did not incite violence. However, the law deals with his intention, and that was certainly to incite violence. The fact that he didn't succeed is neither here nor there.\n\nGriffin is an intelligent manipulator of his group of thugs who hang on his racist words like mad dogs.\n\nThe fact that Griffin spoke at a closed meeting is irrelevant. His words were intended to incite crimes of violence and arson against non-whites by his half-witted foot soldiers. He should have been convicted.

Cyber Sitter is probably the best. It is sends you an e-mail everytime your child goes on somethine suspicious. It also takes pictures and records EVERY website your child's been on. You can also use it to restrict internet access at certain times of the day, and you can also restrict your child from using IM services. Unless your child is known for computer hacking (highly unlikeable) it is nearly impossible for your child to figure out how to disable Cyber Sitter.

As a guy who uses a wheelchair, I bring my own seat.

They are unable to access many portions of the community. Allowing someone to have a seat when they need one is a great step in the right direction.

it looks like a down slope\nThere have been times when powers have fallen and the people in society suffered for as long as 100 years or more, we are facing a heavy time but I hope this time we can get through it with our heads on our shoulders. instead of trying to find someone to stick the blame on for problems (although it seems bush had a lot to do with the problems today) we should try fixing them first.\n\nwe need to concentrate on rebuilding and working together, if we try to do things by ourselves, we will end up with a society without order or right and wrong, we will basically fall extinct.\n\nI'm not sure if this is philosophical of not but it's a good idea.

1887\n\n"In this setting, at Lake Vineyard, Mama and Papa had a son on November 11, 1885. They named him George Smith Patton, Jr., after his father and grandfather. A sickly infant whose nurse, Mary Scally, feared he would die in the first few months, he grew into a strong and healthy, exuberant child. \n\nSoon after his birth, the Pattons moved to Los Angeles, twelve miles to the southwest, so that Papa could be closer to his work. Two years later, they had a daughter, whom they christened Anne and who came to be known as Nita or Anita. Although they lived in town, they spent much time at Lake Vineyard, and Georgie and Nita had the impression of growing up there in the country. "

Cold, concentrated sulfuric acid is used with neutral, water-insoluble compoinds containing no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. If the compound is unsaturated, is readily sulfonated, or possesses a functional group containing oxygen, it will dissolve in cold concentrated sulfuric acid. This is frequently accompanied by a reaction such as sulfonation, polymerization, dehydration, or addition of the sulfuric acid to olefinic or acetylenic linkages. In many cases, however, the solute may be covered by dilution with ice water.
Don't nag him. Nagging just makes them more stubborn. Rather show appreciation for what he DOES do. Compliment his efforts and it will build his self-esteem and make him feel appreciated. Think of something that you can compliment him for if he does nothing. Reward him for his efforts. Give him good sex for doing something around the house and let him know that it's because of that. This might encourage him to do more things for you. ;)

There's not much you can do about it this time, but maybe next time you can see if your mom can give them directly to you so you can take them to your room. Or maybe see if she'll buy your step-dad his own bag. My husband and kids do it to me all the time. It really sucks.

What immigration? Irish who immigrated to America few hundred years ago and kicked the red Indians, or British who immigrated to Australia and Newzealand and killed the natives there, or the new type of immigration which is Africans and Asians coming to Europe and America taking low paid jobs that westerner refuse to do and get treated badly because they are immigrants!!! we are all immigrants! go back hundred years and tell me where did your great grand father came from? Earth belongs to God not to certain group of people. We should fairly compete for a better life, not to support some jobless thugs who hate foreigners!

I would suggest you go as soon as you can. My daughter used to get UTIs all the time and they were so uncomfortable we hated to wait too long. If you have been doctoring the infection on your own for that long, get to the doctor. The meds really help.
Practice by reading an english book out loud to yourself. Try to find one with alot of conversation in it to show you how the speach patterns of people change as they are talking. I'm sure that nothing is wrong with you, except maybe a little bit of insecurity, which we all have so you're great. Best wishes

Generally, yes. There are exceptions though.\n\nOne of the principles behind capitalism is that buyers and sellers are able to freely make decisions about whether to buy or sell, and at what price. If a seller raises his price, buyers should be able to buy less, or buy from someone else.\n\nIf a company has a monopoly, then the buyers have no choice about where to buy. So there are laws and regulations about how monopolies can behave. Examples of monopolies include power companies, and cable companies.\n\nSometimes in natural disasters, some sellers take advantage of the situation to raise prices of things like gas or water by huge amounts. While some may argue that this is the principle of free markets, others feel that this is unfair to disaster victims who have no other options. So there are "price gouging" laws in some places that forbid this kind of thing.\n\nAnd then there's price fixing, which means communicating with your competitors and raising prices together. Again, this is seen as unfair, and so is illegal. Some of the airlines were guilty of this a long time ago.\n\nThere are some other minor restrictions on pricing, but for the most part, aside from doing these things that are considered grossly unfair, businesses are generally free to price however they want.

conservation of momentum and work done by the man tha padles is the answer. actually while paddling you push the water backwards. like the airoplane's turbines that push the air backwards..the net effect is to move forward in order to have a system that the momentum is conserved.
My mother was/is a great mom. I feel she only failed me in teaching me about money/finances. I learned...but late. My daughter is not yet one, but I have already opened up a savings account (I put in a dollar a day). \n\nI wish my mother had warned me about how hard it is to get and stay in good financial standing.
No, I don't think so. She is a bit odd, but she hasn't done anything to deserve that (except that whole Tom Cruise couch jumping thing but that was more on Cruise).

Guy walks up to a girl, and he asks her politely, "May I please have a picture of you?" She asks, "Well why do you want a picture?" He says confidently,"Because I wanna show Santa Claus what I want for Christmas". She giggles. She says,"Are you serious?" He smiles and nods his head. So then she tells him,"Well, I will tell you what, I will give you something a bit better.. here is my number." The guy says,"Your right this is better, I will call you tonight." He then smiles, winks, and walks away.

The most important part of a question is that it be understood, not that it be answered. \n\nTax itentification numbers are issued by the federal government, so contact the IRS. They will, with approriate verification and identification, let you know the TIN that was issued. This has nothing to do with the BIR.\n\nI would not wish to impose on you. Sometimes we just don't know what to do.\n\nSo keep asking questions. Know that you are a very special person, a very intelligent person who can make a difference and make our world a better place
Stop and think about what IQ means literally. It's got next to nothing to do with what you know, but rather, your ability to learn. Someone with a less than 100 (average) IQ can still learn as much as someone with a higher IQ, they will just struggle more doing so. 116 is nothing to be ashamed of.
Physics is directly related to many areas of research such as particle and nuclear physics and astronomy. There is also a large overlap in areas in chemistry and engineering so it is relevant to electronics, material science, energy supply etc. Jobs in both academic research and industry exist in these areas.\n\nIndeed with a physics background it is often possible to go into any kind of scientific research or analysis, even areas in biology, once considered to be the science least related to physics, are asking for physicists. The reason is that it is generally easier to pick-up knowledge in non-physics area than a physics area.\n\nThe mathematical, analytical and computing background of physics is sought after by certain areas of finance, information technology, statistics etc.
Well, thats hard, but you could pull it off by smiling a lot and also having your guy friends go over to him and say "Man she is fine!!!"
LOL. I highly doubt he would not be able to feel his own fart, if another had felt the rumble. Was there a smell afterward? If there was no tell tale fart smell, maybe it wasn't a fart. Otherwise, I think he's just not fessing up.
you sweat all the time, it's just noticeable when you have foundation on is one half.\n\nthe other half is that you actually get warmer, because the foundation is a little bit of a "blanket"\n\nThe solution might be to let your other parts of your body cool you more efficiently so, fewer layers, clothing that can breathe, no head covering, short sleaves... keep shedding stuff (or stay in air conditioning) till you are cool enough that your body doesn't want to sweat.
Yes, he was right
Here is an interesting fact.\n\nPower Grid Corporation of India Limited\n\nPOWERGRID started its commercial operations in 1992-93 and now operates around 40,000 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 66 sub-stations, with transformation capacity of about 32,000 MVA. Presently, about 1/3rd (30,000 MW) of India’s total power is transmitted on the transmission network owned by POWERGRID.
the answer in this link :
No one knows for certain why the human population is right-handed-dominant, but a number of theories have been proposed.\n\nBrain hemisphere division of labor is the most commonly accepted theory of handedness. The premise of this theory is that since both speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, having one hemisphere of the brain do both would be more efficient than having it divided up. And since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness would prevail. It also predicts that left-handed people would have a reversed brain division of labor. Lastly, since other primates do not have a spoken language (at least of the type we have) there would be no stimulus for right-handed preference among them, and that is true.\n\nObjections to this theory claim that it does not explain why the left hemisphere would always be the one controlling language. Why not 50% of the population left and 50% right? While 95% of right-handers do indeed use the left side of the brain for speaking, it is more variable for left-handers. Some do use the right for linguistic skills, some use the left hemisphere, and others use both. On the balance, it appears that this theory could well explain some left-handedness, but it has too many gaps to explain all left-handedness.\n\nThere are more than genetics involved in determining if a person is right- or left-handed Even when both parents are left-handed, there is only a 26% chance of their child being left-handed. Thus, it is clear that genetics is not the only cause. Handedness must also be influenced by some other causes.\n\nBirth stress is theory that states disturbs certain left-handed people, because its basic premise is that left-handedness is due to brain damage during the birth process. Nevertheless, some statistics do back this theory up.\n\nParental pressure theory explains right-handed dominance by claiming that since the parents who raised us are mostly right-handed, we came to be mostly right-handed and so on.

That's easy\nThe key to projectile motion is resolving motion horizontally and vertically(or downwards).The vertical motion is accelerated motion,acceleration being g while horizontal motion is not accelerated and is at constant speed.\nSuppose at time t=0 the ball leaves the table.\nVh(0)=3m/s Horizontal Velocity\nVd(0)=0m/s Downwards velocity\nNow time taken to hit floor is same as time taken by downwards velocity component to cover 1.25 m\nUse s=ut+1/2 gt^2 here u=Vd(0)\n1.25=0+0.5*9.8*t^2\nt=sqrt(1.25/(.5*9.8))\nt= 0.50507 sec\nTo calculate how far it travels just multiply this time by Vh(0) \n3*.50507=1.515m
Doctor J has very good and relevant points... but my answer for a method would be - Take rest!\n\nGive your foot plenty of rest, try not to move around too much as it will only cause more stress, and delay healing. Try to let at least 2-3 weeks go by without moving too much, so as to promote healing.
Your state should have a Department of Education. Go to their website. It should provide information about every school in the state, including testing scores for previous years, demographics, and rankings.
If you have a fever (over 100F) you might have strep throat or pharyngitis. If you are having difficulty swallowing or breathing definitely go see a doctor. If it is an infection it should be able to be treated by antibiotics.
Secretaries get more kidney problems because their urethra is shorter than men and when they spend hours holding their urine in their bladder sometimes reflux can occur and cause a kidney infection. Secretaries and truck drivers spend a lot of time in one position and procrastinate urination and this leads to stasis of urine and multiplication of bacteria.
For your sex and height, your ideal weight is 135 pounds but the ideal weight range is 127 pounds to 159 pounds. So you see you are just one pound over the range so you are hardly overweight.\nhttp://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/iwc\nYour weight does not just depend on exercise and diet. They are very important and other factors such as genetics, medical conditions, hormones and drugs come into play as well as your mental state. Some medical conditions are related to infertility such as hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome etc. I think you need to have a chat with your doctor if you want to do something about your weight although as I have shown above, you don't really have a weight problem yet.\n\nI agree with your mates that you look fine. Is your husband backing off because of your weight or because there are no kids? I think you need to have a good chat and thrash that out. He is supposed to stick by you through thick and thin and so far as you are not doing anything to wreck the marriage, he has no excuse for his behaviour.\n\nAlso remember that true beauty is not just your looks. People will be attracted to you because of your character, how warm you are, how friendly you are etc.\n\nLastly, don't let anyone put you down. You may have gained weight but you are not overweight. \n\nAll the best. If no one loves you, God loves you so forget about everyone else!

Try to use years instead of months to indicate the duration of each job. If your gaps are several years, maybe you can address that in your cover letter. Otherwise, those questions could/need to be answered during the interview.\n\nBelow are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results. Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format. It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.

I have hunted for more than 40 years, and it took me 15 years of dedicated archery and firearm hunting to bag my first 10 point buck (actually was 12 pointer) and it was during a depredation hunt to control deer numbers on agricultural land. There weren't supposed to be many bucks there, let alone huge ones (mine weighed 220 field dressed). You're quite lucky, but don't let it go to your head. Best results are achieved through knowledge, experience and preparation. Don't count on luck. Good Hunting.

It depends on the size of your frame, but for a medium framed woman who's 5'7", the ideal weight is 135 - 139 pounds (61 - 63 kilograms). For a small framed woman, it would be 126 - 130 pounds (57 - 59 kilograms). For a large framed woman, it would be 144 - 148 pounds (65 - 67 kilograms).

The ideal manager is one who isn't afraid of work and commitment.\nThey should be fair yet firm, strict yet approachable and above all be understanding to his consumer! Whether right or wrong morally, the customer is always right and any good manager should uphold this and make their staff aware of the protocol.\n\nAn ideal manager should have happy and reliable staff working under him which makes for an excellent work force ensuring greater customer care. This makes a good foundation for any business.\n\nThe manager of any business should understand the environment they are working in. They should ensure they know each and every product available, when it will be in stock, how it works, what the next best product is etc. \nIn my experience, the best type of Manager is one who has worked their way from the bottom to the top. They have worked directly with the public and are therefore aware of the demands and pit falls with being in such an environment.

Well, this task is very easily done if you have Microsoft Office (usually comes with the software bundle from MDG computers). All you need to do is open up Microsoft PowerPoint and use the Slideshow wizard to get you started. PowerPoint is all about making slide shows with text, sounds, videos, and pictures. And after about an hour or so and twiddling with the features, you'll be all set for making your presentation. Best of all, most school computers have PowerPoint on them so you can send your ppt file from home and open it up at school to present.

I think what you are referring to is oil shale, not the same as crude being pumped out of the ground by the familiar means, and I believe the US has the largest reserves and I just read that total WORLD reserves is "conservatively estimated at 2.6 trillion barrels". There is some reserves that are too deep to be mined economically, but overall, it is rather expensive to tap this oil resource.(http://emd.aapg.org/technical_areas/oil_shale.cfm).

Reality check!!\nLittle one. This is where you and he find comfort in your relationship. You're not dating anymore. You are a couple. 98% of all men, once they get in their comfort zone, we relax. If we're right with everything, then we start to concentrate on more important stuff like taking care of you and the family we will make. We are men, the providers. It's in our nature. We are trained to be. Is he there with you? Does he come home at the same time everyday? Are you together on the weekends? If you answer no to any of these questions, then have concerns.\nI love my wife and will do whatever it takes to make her happy. I do still talk silly with her. I hold her hand, open the door for her. I always tell her I love her. I will take her anywhere she would like to go. I don't, however, buy her flowers everytime we go out. Once in awhile, I'll surprise her.\nThe dating is over and the relationship begins.\n\nGood luck.
If you take a really strong and careful interest in things, and associate new information with experiences and ideas that you're well-versed-in, that should help a lot. In my experience, it's often a matter of convincing yourself to care more deeply about whatever information is coming your way. If you approach new facts with the attitude of intensity and (reasonable) amazement, stuff just tends to stick.

The Brihadisvara temple was built by the great Tamil ruler, Rajaraja Chola I of the Chola dynasty. The shikaram, an octagonal, carved cupola, itself is very large and heavy and, until recently, was thought to be carved out of a single stone. However during one of the cleaning efforts, it was found to be in two pieces. The task of carrying this huge crown to a height of 70 meters is another feat worth mentioning. In order to do this, an inclined plane of sand was built from a distance of nearly 11 kilometers. The place where this scaffold began is called the Sarap pallam.
It depends from what angle you are looking at. Let's go through a few:\n\nGrammar.\nPortuguese and Spanish grammar share pretty similar grammar in terms of syntax (word order etc), and the idea of nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. However, portuguese is slightly more complex in that they have pronoun contractions (for example 'give that to me' uses a contraction of 'to' and 'me' to form 'mo' (me+o=mo). Spanish uses the two pronouns seperately. \n\nVerb-wise, the portuguese has the same tenses as spanish, however where the spanish might use a compounded form only (eg the pluperfect tense being comprised of the imperfect form of 'haber' plus the past participle), Portuguese interchanges between a compound form ('ter' + past participle), it also has an inflected form (eg 'comprar' becomes either 'tenhia comprado' or 'comprava').\n\nThe Portuguese also likes to make work for itself in that it has two forms of the past participle. The 'proper' form as it were for grammatical use, and the 'irregular' form for expression as an adjective eg 'impresso' and not 'imprimido' for 'printed'.\n\n\nVocabulary\nYes, portuguese does share a LOT of vocabulary with spanish. HOWEVER, in a lot of cases they have completely different words for things eg 'crianca' (excuse the lack of accent) for girl, where it is 'chica' in spanish. As previously mentioned, sometimes the word exists in both languages, but means another thing altogether (eg 'polvo' meaning 'octopus' in portuguese, but 'dust' in spanish).\n\nACCENT\nThe portuguese accent is VERY VERY different to spanish. It sounds like a Russian trying to speak Spanish while trying to eat. Lots of nasalised vowels and clipped endings. This is especially moreso in Brazilian portuguese, where they are even more nazally.\n\nIn conclusion, Portuguese is harder to learn than spanish, but if you've already got knowledge of spanish it should be fairly easy to pick up.
Well, I agree. You learn from your mistakes, as they always say. If you fail, you know what not to do the next time around. The Wright Brothers had many problems with airplanes, and they failed many times...but every time they failed, they knew what not to do the next time they tried it. Now look where airplanes are today...
ok
hello Alex. First of all, calm down. If somebody is nice to you, then it does not necessarily mean that he fancied you. some friends feel that they should be good friends to others but not necessary dig deeper into intimacy. In friendship there exists a relationship of brotherhood, which, believe me, is extremely nice. It does not involve intimacy at all, but the discussions between the couple are (I would say) deeper, brighter, friendlier, direct to the point, confidential, trustworthy, well I can keep on going for ages. I do have friends in this brotherhood and I really value their friendship. \n\nNow if you feel that you have been hurt by this encounter, take your time to brush it off your nerves, so that you will not make any mistakes, approach this friend and make things clear. However do not lose on this friendship, treasure it in any other way. Friends can be valuable you know and when chasing them off you might be chucking out more than one (you never know who is around and listening). \n\nTake your time Alex, don't rush things. Don't worry I am sure you are a wonderful person and people would understand you.\n\nGood Luck

i'll try to explain. ichiban = number 1, the best, the most. genki is a bit harder to explain. in the sentence, "genki desu ka?", you are asking somebody if they are okay, fine, in good condition. the reply to that is "genki desu", "i'm fine". it also means, energetic or playful. example: that girl is so genki!" in some ways, it also implies cuteness. like in manga/anime, it's not impossible to find a story with a title like "the adventures of the genki boy/girl" do you get it? so i guess your friend's cat is a burst of energy, hence s/he got that monicker, which i think is cute.
well supposedly they sent subatomic particles from point a to point B in 0 time, or traveling "through time", even though the term is usually misintrepretted.\n\nSteven hawkings book a brief history of time says time is a property that is associated with light(and some vague recollection of gravitation from reading it years back), in that if you pass the speed of light matter doesnt take any time to move through physical space.\n\n\nWithout being able to count the amount of time it takes to get from point a to be makes the word 'speed' meaningless.

See her less often, maybe an afternoon once a month. And when you do, be patient with her and always treat her nice no matter how bad she gets. After all, it's only a few minutes of your life, right?\n\nThing is, most mothers behave like this, no matter how old you get. You'll always be her child, and that's what she sees when she looks at you so don't be too pis*ed about that.
As a rule when they argue that the economy is good it is because of the increase in jobs. Which there is an increase and a rather large one, unfortunately it is mainly in very low-paying jobs, jobs that quite a few are unwilling to take (very hard to work at McDonalds after practically any other job). \n\nBush is arguing trickle-down economics. The rich are making much more money, and it is assumed they will use this money to create more businesses to make themselves more money, but the natural side effect of the rich creating more businesses for themselves is that there should be more jobs for the rest of us (blue-collar workers). We have yet to see it actually work out, and it didn't do so hot when Reagan gave it a shot, but the theory is a sound one. I just don't think it will work in the end myself, but I'm not an economist.

Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine

It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.

Let me say first that a lot of things that you find on the internet are incorrect/outdated. For example: http://www.coolnurse.com/marriage_laws.htm states that in GA a pregnant minor can marry without parental consent. They USED to be able to, but GA has now changed that law and pregnant minors can no longer marry in GA without parental consent.\n\nAnd DON’T run off and get pregnant thinking that you will then be able to get married or obtain permission from a judge to get married, because it’s usually denied. A pregnancy ALONE does not automatically mean that marriage is in the best interest of the minor and is not normally a sufficient enough reason for a judge to override a parents rights/wishes by granting a minor permission to marry when their parents object to it.\n\nAnd as far as emancipation, which is VERY hard to obtain by the way, there are states where emancipation does not give a minor the right to get married. \n\nAt 18 you can get married.

Yeah, there'd be war. I think most "religious" wars have non-religious causes like ethnic hatred, land disputes, power, and politics. I mean take a look at the world's major religions; they all preach peace and harmony. It's the people themselves who distort the religion to fit their own needs. If it weren't religion, it'd just be some other unifying factor such as race, nationality or ethnicity. War is caused by something in human nature, not in religion.

I quit for three weeks before and could have stayed quit except I gave into a thought to get a pack when I was really stressed out.\nI regret that move. It only took one cigarette to get me hooked again. I can tell you that to be smoke free for three weeks, what I did was pray and ask God to help me. I said, I can't do this on my own, and I am asking for help. So, I threw the half filled pack in the trash and didn't smoke for three weeks. So, if you have decided to quit that you're sick of the habit I know you can do it, just be prepared for the thoughts like I had and don't give in to them. I wish you all the best...

I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. They did some things I didn't agree with at all.\n\nI was mad about Xavier dying, no matter what the clip at the end of the credits showed. I was mad as Scott dying. I could see him being a tragic figure for a long time, but I think he would have pulled out of it if given a chance. I think they over-did pretty much all of the fight scenes to make up for a weak plot, and the emotional scenes, with the exception of the one where Rogue leaves and the part right after Xavier died, fell pretty flat. I greatly dislike that Rogue actually took the cure, no matter that the end shows evidence that it's not as permanent as the humans thought. I thought that she'd turn up during the last fight scene and drain Magneto or Phoenix. I dislike that she came back to Bobby, too. Let Kitty have him. And I thought the ending with all of its sunshine and happiness was a little too trite. I also do NOT like Storm as the leader of the X-Men.\n\nOkay, now for what I did like. I liked the Rogue and Wolverine scene where she leaves, obviously, because that rang true for me. I actually liked their explanation of how Jean survived and how Phoenix came into being. That part was better than the comics or the cartoons, in my opinion. I liked that they gave the background of Jean in film rather than dialogue alone. I liked most of the fight scenes as being well done by the actors, and I liked that Wolverine killed Jean because I'm a sadistic person who never liked Jean in the first place and thought she was playing Wolverine a bit too much in the last too movies. I'm protective of Wolverine. I also liked Beast, pretty much through the whole movie. Loved him. Laughed especially hard at "Oh, h@*&, you get the point!"\n\nMostly, though, *wailing* I WANT ROGUE BACK AS ROGUE!\n\nSorry. At least she would get the chance to feel love through a touch a little before her powers came back, though.

YES! I personally have purchased 2 houses and a 3 unit apartment house this way. I put a grand total of 12 dollars down payment ( in MI, a real estate contract isn't valid unless some money changes hands) I flipped 2 of them and kept the 3 unit for a couple of years, then sold it too. My credit score is around 525 but I never went through any credit checks with the owners. It does take a LOT of persistence and determination though.

From what I've read online, DTH is a satellite system, so this will not be possible unless you have a satellite dish receiver on your radio. This is because satellites use frequencies on the order of about 15 GHz. Your AM/FM radio antenna will only pick up frequencies up to about 110 MHz. \n\nFurther, DTH signals are digital. An AM/FM radio is purely analog. Thus, even if you had a satellite dish that was the right size and pointed in the right direction, all you would hear is garbage. The signals are compressed and encrypted, so you need hardware to convert the analog signal to digital, and then decompress and unencrypt the data.\n\nSo, in short, the answer is a definitive no. Sorry buddy.

Contact your local or state dental association and and see if there are any dentists who provide free or reduced cost care for low-income, disabled or senior patients.\n\nCall your local health department and ask about health centers that provide dental care for free or on a sliding scale.\n\nYour local United Way may also be aware of such a clinic. In some areas, you can reach them now by dialing 2-1-1 for "non-emergency information."\n\nGo to a dental school, if there is one near you, for reduced costs.\n\nIf you are a senior citizen, call your local Area Agency on Aging or Office on Aging. If you can not find a listing in your local phone book on the "County Government" pages (usually marked with blue borders), call toll-free 1-800-677-1116 to find how to contact the Area Agency on Aging serving you.\n\nCheck http://www.toothwoman.net to see if low-cost or free dental services are available near you.\n\nCheck http://bphc.hrsa.gov and choose "Find a Health Center" to see if there is a low-cost clinic near you.\n\nCheck http://www.nfdh.org/DDS.html to see if your state has a "Donated Dental Services" program. D.D.S. is designed to locate dentists who will give free care to patients who are financially compromised due to medical problems. This is a process that will take a couple of months to get your information and then arrange for someone to see you. Not all states have D.D.S. programs.\n\nIf worse comes to worse, check out http://www.prosper.com and see if you can find a funding source.

Both studies can be done when a woman is on her period. A transvaginal ultrasound might be embarrasing/messy for the patient, so if you are worried about that, then schedule at a different point of your cycle. We do transvag u/s on women who are bleeding and at risk for miscarriage routinely.
As to your first question, generally yes, the sale of this property will "wipe out" all other creditors. The exception would be if something wasn't found on the report that they use (typically the attorney who is handling the foreclosure orders a report that "guarantees" the sale). The attorneys use this report to make sure that everyone has been notified. That's also why they are required to "post" the sale in conspicuous places. So, I would recommend getting a title search to see what is in fact out there on this property.\n\nAs to the second question, that's the hard part about buying from a foreclosure or seizure. The lender takes time to do all of it's stuff (underwriting, appraisals, etc), and normally you don't have a lot of time before the sale. I'd suggest talking to your bank or your local mortgage consultants. Tell them exactly what you want to do, and they'll tell you whether or not they can help. Hopefully, you'll find one that can, but it won't be easy. Typically at a foreclosure/seizure/sheriff's sale, you need to have the money within moments of having the winning bid. Okay, that part isn't so bad, but what if there are other people bidding against you? It doesn't happen often (in my 5 years of this, I never saw it happen and only heard of it once), but it can happen. \n\nI hope all of this helps out. Good luck, I hope you get it and that it's in immaculate shape!

PR6 (or PR0 to PR10) refers to the PageRank Display on the Google Toolbar http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html&hl=en and according to Google tells you "... how Google's algorithms assess the importance of the page you're viewing".\n\nProfessional SEOs refer to it as Toolbar PR or TPR to differentiate it from the PageRank formulated by Google's Brin and Page in this paper http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html which can have non integer values outside the range 0-10.\n\nThe relationship between PR and TPR is assumed to be logarithmic but outside of a few engineers in Google no one knows the exact relationship or even if there is any direct relationship at all. \n\nBecause PageRank is keyword independent the search engine results pages are not in TPR order and pages with a lower TPR will often rank higher than pages with a higher TPR for any given search term.\n\nBecause of those things and the fact that TPR is only updated every 3 months or so it is only of interest to the lower echelons of the SEO community and completely disregarded by the professional SEOs.\n\nI advise you to disregard it as well and concentrate or more important metrics.

Seems like you are blaming everything on yourself girl, and you have gotten into a pattern of apologising everytime, if he thinks you are going to keep doing this he will keep pushing itto see how far he can go with it. If your away and you are going to be back in two months have fun for yourself, tell him you will see him when you get back and see where it will go from there. maybe he will realise after no communication for a while just how much he wants you. I know you love him and it will be hard but give it a go.
I was a bridesmaid for my girlfriend a few years ago. At that time my hubby and I had been married for 7 years and had three kids. The night b4 the wedding all us girls spent the night at the hotel. I missed hubby so much that night - I wanted him there to share the time with. My girlfriend looked at me and started to cry - she said she was so glad I was there with her that night - not only for the moral support and the fun - but because I was her only married friend and she enjoyed seeing how after almost 10 years together I missed him when he wasn't around. \nPhysical attraction is obvious - and a vital part of all relationships - but it is the thoughtfullness and the caring that indicates how you really feel

"On October 8, 1957, O'Malley announced that after 68 seasons in Brooklyn, the Dodgers would be moving to Los Angeles. In a move to bring baseball to all parts of the country, O'Malley also convinced Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move his Giants the same year to San Francisco. Just a little more than six months later, on April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first game in Los Angeles, defeating the Giants 6-5 before 78,672 fans at the Coliseum."\n- Patrick Spreng

It all depends on what the program is, and its specific system requirements.\n\nCertain programs (like Word, Powerpoint) could care less about what type of processor it is, as long as the system is running WIndows.\n\nOther software, like ProTools, has very specific hardware requirements, and deviating from their favorites list will just cause you much drama.\n\nOther software can flip-flop either way. MS-Excel for example acts the same with both CPU's until you get into some super large numbers (2 to the 50th power or something like that) or extremely complex mathematical formulae (like what brokerage firms or actuaries might use). AMD processes mathematical calculations slightly different than Intel, and it will show up in complex calculations.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is to check the programs' system requirements.

Is chemistry a good subject to learn - yes, if for no other reason than to give you an appreciation for the world around you. As for if chemists have a future, everything around you probably had a chemist working on it. For example, the food you eat, the computer you are using, the water you drink, etc. all had chemists working on them. Quality control for purity must be performed on almost everything, and that is normally done by a chemist. I recently graduated in chemistry, and I am having no difficulty finding jobs.

Your question suggests you want an answer that only involves 2 dimensions. This is not possible. If you arrange the sticks in a star shape as has been suggested then once two sticks touch you cannot get any more across the boundary they create. If you are allowed into the 3rd dimension slightly then you can arrange the sticks as follows. Arrange two sticks in a V shape. Insert another stick into the V so it touches the other two sticks but doesn't push them apart. I don't have a character on my keyboard to illustrate but the result will look like the three fingers remaining if you folded your thumb and little finger down. Now do the same but laying the remaining three sticks on top on the three you just put down and making sure the neck of the second V is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the first.

If it is an occasional coke or coffee - go for it. \n\njust dont pound the red bulls.\n\nThe medical literature does not make strong associations between caffeine intake and bad outcome with heart valve patients, so use the maxim that moderation is good for everything in life.
i'm sorry man, but you don't know what you are missing. fantasy sports is a better way to improve your knowledge of sports trivia, and you could also be there to witness a lot of history being made. If you are not a sports fan, then I feel sorry for you.

nope, can't do it.\nHappy Thanksgiving though!

I agree with you. I once saw an "adult apron" and realized that to me that meant "pornographic apron"\n\nThat being said, that sort of usage has been around for a long time and it is unlikely to change soon. It doesn't usually cause that many problems.
As long as the doctors have checked it out, its does sound as if you may need to start by addressing the weight and the stress, get those sorted and if its still there make them check you out again
There are actually several. The elephant is the most obvious because it is so heavy. Many mamals don't jump very well such as the sloth.\n\nBut I guess you would then have to argue about what constitutes "straight up in the air" and what is a "standing position"?
It is not a wash sale. That comes into play only if you buy the stock back within 30 days.

yes, that is right. The secant function 'sec(θ)' gives the reciprocal of the cosine function 'cos(θ)'. We know that\n\ncos(θ) = x/r (as per your case)\n\nthus, \n\nsec(θ) = 1/cos(θ) = r/x\n\nHence proved.
Prairie refers to an area of land in North America of low topographic relief that principally supports grasses and herbs, with few trees, and is generally of a mesic (moderate or temperate) climate. Most of the Great Plains, including the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and much of Missouri and Minnesota, is considered prairie. French explorers called these areas prairie, from the French word for "meadow". Almost all of this area has been converted into farmland in the last two hundred years. Sometimes in the United States and Canada distinction is made between the shortgrass vegetation of the High Plains west of the 100th meridian and the tallgrass vegetation to the east from central Texas to Minnesota and southern Manitoba. When this distinction is made, it is common to limit the word "prairie" to the tallgrass area.\n\nIn Canada, the terms Prairie provinces and the Prairies refer to the western provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where prairie grasslands and shrubs abound (see Canadian Prairies).\n\nFire is an important part of prairie ecology; natural and human induced fires were common in historic prairie areas. Grazing by animals such as the American Bison and Prairie dogs also helped maintain the original prairie ecology. Small areas of prairies also exist in eastern North America, and it is possible that these were created by Native Americans by periodic burning. One such area was along the southeastern shore of Lake Erie in what is now Pennsylvania and New York; another was between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in present New York.\n\n \nPrairie grassesPrairies are considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Other temperate grasslands regions include the Pampas of Argentina, and the steppes of Russia and Ukraine.
There is too much to do in this case.\n\nGet the syllabus and go on hunt for material.\nYou have to start from first getting proper material for these two subjects. To get good material you may want to take help of some good book stalls or coaching colleges. Once you material then would suggest go through the books, mark relevant portion as per subject and do a basic reading of the books. After that depending on how much you can spend, go for classroom coaching either to individual teacher or coaching college.\n\nKeep your self updated with what all is happening, practice, study, revise, write and take mock tests.
you know what there are rules for a reason the government isn't gonna change that , it would show weakness . so yeah it was stupid for them to lose money that they could have earned that day working. personally if i was a employer I would treat them like they wanted to be treated I would tell them like i would tell a legal American , you skip work your fired!
It depends on what exactly you are looking for. I don't know of many places in the city that are cheap (I have found some good deals at Lombaridi's on Polk, but not cheap), but if you have a car or can borrow one go to Tri-City at 40900 Grimmer Blvd in Fremont. There I have found some of the best deals on all types of new gear; clothing, skis and snowboards. The later you go in the season, the cheaper things get (of course).\n\nIf you do not mind buying used or surplus gear, try the Wilderness Exchange in Berkeley (1407 San Pablo Ave), the store is great. I have found some good deals there on winter clothing and camping gear.

The Yellow River, or Huanghe, is the second longest river in China. Tracing to a source high up the majestic Yagradagze mountain in the nation's far west, it loops north, bends south, and flows east for 5,464 km until it empties into the sea, draining a basin of 745,000 sq km, which nourishes 120 million people. \nhttp://www.cis.umassd.edu/~gleung/geofo/geogren.html\nhttp://www.cis.umassd.edu/~gleung/\n---------------\nKnown as the mother river by all the Chinese people, the 5464-kilometer (about 3395 miles) Yellow River is the second longest river in China after the Yangtze River . The headwaters of this mighty river lie in Kunlun Mountains in northwestern Qinghai Province. It runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions on its way to the Bohai Sea.\nhttp://www.travelchinaguide.com/yellow-river/index.htm
I assume that you meant for 7xeY + 3x^3 = 5y^4 to mean 7xe^y + 3x^3 = 5y^4.\n\nWe now take dy/dx of both sides:\nD(7x)e^y + D(e^y)7x + D(3x^3) = D(5y^4). D refers to the derivative. \nThus we get 7e^y + 7xe^yy' + 9x^2 = 20y^3y'. \nSimplify this to be 7e^y + 9x^2 = 20y^3y' - 7xe^yy' . \nNow factor out the y': 7e^y + 9x^2 = y'(20y^3 - 7xe^y). \n\nSolve for y': The final answer is (7e^y + 9x^2)/(20y^3 - 7xe^y). This is choice d. \n\nMake sure to use proper parentheses.

I don't know if anyone's heard of this guy but a man named Alvin Toffler explained it all in a book called The Third Wave. \n\nHe explains that we are in our third wave of history which is the age of technology and learning. The first wave was an agricultural based society and the second wave was an industry based society. \n\nWell, since we jump from each wave of history so quickly, people experience something called future shock. This is a term to describe a sort of disorientation fromn too much change in too short a period of time. \n\nSo basically, that's why so many adults are overwhelmed by computers and have to ask the younger egneration to explain how to use them. Because, we are in a an age of technology, it's very rare to see people reading anymore. People used to read constantly and now most people only read for educational purposes insread of for pleasure. We rely onj technology to do all the dirty work for us. Calculators, computers, are great examples of this. \n\nMy history teacher was telling us that less than 100 years ago the average high school senior had a vocablary of about 40,000 words. In our stupid society today, the average high school senior has a vocabulary of about 20,000 words. What happened to the lost 20,000 words? Yeah, we are allowing our selves to become more and more moronic.
Cell phone is short for cellular phone. Cellular refers to the technology used. Also, a mobile phone can almost be considered as just about any phone that can leave a base and does not have a cord.\n\nAs quoted from source: \n\n"Term used currently in the United States and Canada (and in other countries as well during the 1980s) to refer to most mobile phones. It technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network. In developing mobile phone technology, American electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next. After the name "cell" was applied to the zone covered by each antenna, it was a natural choice for them to apply the term "cellular" to both the technology and the phones that ran on it."

Whatever all that Q stuff means. Cops do not contest rights, they enforce the law. If you break a law, even if you feel its a violation of your rights, the cops can do nothing about it...the decision as to whether it is a violation or you will be punished is in the jurisdiction of the court to decide.\n\nTake a good luck at the work of Martin Luther King Jr. with peaceful civil disobedience. If you get involved in an issue regarding civil rights, you must be willing to be arrested. Peaceful civil disobedience has several facets. One, you do not resist arrest. Two, if arrested you stay in jail as the goal is to fill the jails (hit the government where the money is). Three, when you do get out, you go back out and do it again. Four, you tie up the court system. Sooner or later the issue will be adjudicated at the Supreme Court level which is the ultimate goal. GBU\n\nOkay, since we are having some fun with this. In my opinion the predominant right in any given situation if the Freedom of Speech...without which, btw, we would not be sitting here answering Q's.

If you are very much over weight, I would think vegetarian diet is the best choice for you because you can help your body reduce the fat that make you over weight. But if you are not over weight or under weight, then eating a combined meat and vegetarian diet is more ideal for you.On the other hand, if you are ok with your weight but having heart or other health problems like high cholestrol and so on... then you should eat more vegetable and fruits but cut down on red meat, white meat without the fat can be eaten in moderation to provide the protein your body needs.

Wow. You are really taking Lev 26:30 out of context!!!\n\nYou're making it seem like God wants people to eat their own children. \n\nRead the entire passage. It's talking about famine being the result of disobedience against God. \n\nThousands of years ago, if a famine struck, it was not uncommon for people to begin eating the flesh of those who had already died -- even their own family members. \n\nWow. Rarely have I seen someone so desperate to discredit and disparage religion, that they have taken a Bible verse so badly out of context. \n\nHow utterly desperate you must be to prove your point, that you would resort to such an argument "tactic."

One of the main reasons that there is so much poverty in the world is because of the evil dictators that rule some of these poverty stricken countries. They take control of any revenue making buisness, as well as funds that other countries send to help out these countries, and keep it all for themselves. They live in huge palaces living and eating it up,all the while their people are living in shacks and going hungry.\nMost of the people in America do not know true poverty, not to say all, but most, considering that even our poorest own TV's. There is no reason for any child in this country to go hungry at night, with all the social programs, food banks and such that we have to help others out.

Hi,\nI understand your concern and imagine that you would be alarmed at what you said is happening to you.\nFrom what I understand, you just reached puberty (14?), and at this time, when your body's getting adjusted to the changes that launch you into womanhood, a lot of different confusing things can happen all at once.\nIt is not entirely unusual when a woman's periods are just getting started, to have some irregularities...missed periods, unexpected periods, prolonged periods...e.t.c. The cycles that happen at this time are known as "anovulatory cycles", and the hormonal changes taking place are responsible for these.These changes are different for different women.\nChances are there's nothing wrong with you, and there's no reason to be alarmed.\nIf you see a doctor, he'd probably not do a pap smear, as this is usually done to screen for diseases you most likely, given your age and apparent innocence, do not have. He'd probably take a more detailed history, and may examine you to be sure there is no other reason why you're having the problem. Such reason could include foreign body (like tissue etc) in your vagina, or other incidental reason why you're bleeding, and also may include bleeding disorders. This would however be unlikely if you do not have a history of bleeding much after minor injuries or under the skin resulting in discolorations.\nI hope this was helpful to you. This is however no substitute to getting medical opinion on your health.
Or otherwise what
Probably. Eventually he'll be a jerk to you, too. Why would you want to be with someone who is a jerk to everyone, anyway? Don't you want a social life? Don't you want your friends and family around? He could be a controlling person who wants you all to himself, so he tries to drive everyone else away. I'd avoid him like he was poison... because he is.

Not too sure about Airport time out issues either. For VNC, I use that a lot between my Macs and PCs. On the Mac (10.4 preferred), you can either turn on Apple's own Apple Remote Desktop (System Pref -> Sharing, choose Apple Remote Desktop. Click on Access privileges, grant yourself full access + check on the VNC viewers ... and set a password) OR OSXVNC (free ... the new version is called Vine Server) To install this guy, download it from their site (you can do a Yahoo search on osxvnc). Double click the DMG file, drag and drop the content (Vine Server) onto your Application folder. To configure it, launch the app, set a password and you're set to go! Client for VNC, I would go with "Chick of the VNC". Do the same get process as osxvnc, search for it on Yahoo, get the DMG, drag to Application folder and launch! It can memorize your controlled machines, which is cool. It doesn't care if the destination is Mac or Win as long as you have the right IP address and password. Right clicking on a VNC Win machine can be a pain if you don't have dual button mouse. You have to hold down control + shift + click to do right click on the PC you're controlling.\n\nOn Windows, I use UltraVNC (also free). It comes with both server and clients. The server is as easy to setup as OSXVNC (when you launch it, it stays on your tray, double click it to give it a password) Then, with the client, supply the IP address of the Mac or Win you want to control + password. There's also WinVNC -- the downside is that WinVNC will auto start itself, you have to manually shut it down if you don't want it running all the time. There are 64 bit versions of the VNC for UltraVNC -- do a quick yahoo search of "ultravnc 64"

College students are more often there because they want to be rather than because they have to be. So they are more motivated and professors can teach and help students learn rather than having to drag students toward knowledge. College requires more self direction than most high schools expect -- you have to take responsibility for your own learning. And college professors are more likely to see their students as at least potential peers. Most college courses teach students how to learn rather than giving you a textbook of things you need to know -- you read from primary (original) sources, do research, etc. You can learn and have fun in both places -- in college you need to be responsible for both.\nIn some places high school students can take a college course -- in Minnesota a high school student can enroll in a college course for free and get college credit. Check to see if a similar program is available where you are.

Aorta is the largest artery in the body, the aorta arises from the left ventricle of the heart, goes up. ( ascends ) a little ways, bends over (arches), then goes down (descends) through the chest and through the abdomen to where ends by dividing into two arteries called illac arteries that goes to the legs.\n\nAnatomically, the aorta is traditionally divided into the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and descending aorta. \n The descending aorta is, in turn, subdivided into the thoracic aorta (thatdecends with the chest) and the abdominal aorta (that decends with the belly.) \n\nThe aorta gives off branches that goes to the head neck, the arms, the major organs in the chest and abdomen, and legs. It serves to supply them all oxygenated blood. The aorta is the central conduit from the heart to the body.

I don't know the monkey, but of course it wont make a good pet. You are trying to domestic a wild animal - a process that takes generations and rush it into one. When you buy an exotic animal, you will not know how to properly care for it. It will cause problems in your life because it doesn't belong in your house. And you will probably be the cause of its death because of your selfish decision.

My favorite X-Men comic character is Iceman. I suppose because he reminds me a lot of my favorite Marvel character of all time, Spider-Man. Both characters have their serious side, but are still witty, even in a fight. As you can imagine, I enjoyed watching "Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends" as a kid. I really don't think Iceman, or most of the original X-Men lineup for that matter, have ever been given fair treatment in the movies.\n\nAs far as characters I'd like to have seen in the films, I will use the last member of the "Amazing Friends" I've yet to mention, Firestar. Granted, she didn't appear in a comic book until well after her TV debut, but I would still like to see this "hottie" included in an X-Men movie. Since Pyro is in the movies, having the two of them face off would be interesting, to say the least. If Firestar created flames, one would have to wonder if Pyro could take control of them & turn them against her allies.

Passing on the right in California IS legal ...\n\n21755. The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only under conditions permitting such movement in safety.

reading is the key to knowledge... You can find reading material on just about ANY subject in the world. I love to read and I will never read enough in my lifetime to obtain all the knowledge that I seek...\n\nknowledge can be interrperated in to wisdom.. only if the knowledge is true and factual. I say read all you can, whenever you can... Knowledge and Power is the ultimate key correct? Why not enlighten yourself!!!!!!
eeeeeeeyooooooowwwwwwww. Was it good for you it sure helped me, I should make that a part of my day. Wait a minute here comes security with their weapons drawn.

Fear of exams is actually a very common problem among school-age children. First, it's a good idea to make certain that the fear is not brought on by a learning problem or disability. For example, some children do very poorly on exams because they read slowly or with great difficulty. They can do the regular homework well because they work very hard and are bright. But in a timed test situation, they can't keep up. One hint of this is a child who answers the first half of the test questions correctly, but doesn't get to the second half of the questions at all (and thus earns a very low score). \n\nTest-taking anxiety is often easy to deal with using relaxation and mental imagery techniques. With a little coaching, most children quickly learn to think pleasant, restful thoughts and enjoy the feeling of their bodies relaxing. They can then give themselves instructions to feel calm and relaxed during tests. Somehow, the body remembers, and they do in fact feel calmer during tests. Many child psychologists and pediatricians are skilled in teaching children relaxation. Some call this process self hypnosis, but I think that makes it sound more mysterious than it really is.

First of all why do some men marry ? To celebrate their relationship , to belong to the woman they love , to have a friend , to have a family of their own .\nI guess the others refuse because of fear of taking responsibility (once you are committed/married, all major decision of life are influenced by it e.g., changing job, moving to new location etc. ) or fear of confiding in other person so much as to make them a part of your life and become theirs . Some do not believe in the institution of marriage because for their own reasons . \nWomen generally want to stay in a relationship & work on it even if it is not going on the right track with the hope that it might work . Guys dont . They know if its not a correct choice , its not worth giving life for .\n And for some , variety is the spice of life :))
I think you may be mixing things up a bit.\n\nYou can become a Registered Nurse without getting a Bachelors of Science but it is getting harder to find nursing programs that do that.\n\nYou should TRY and get a Bachelor of Science Registered Nursing degree if you can. I am not a nurse, but I work with a lot of them in a hospital and I see the job postings. Most job postings are looking for BS RN. More opportunity for you if you go that route, more advancement, management etc. BIGGER PAYCHECKS.\n\nBut do not let that stop you, if you can become a Registered Nurse without it then go for it. You can always get the BS degree later on.\n\nGood luck.

What we tend to see when we look into the eyes of others - besides seeing the details of their eyes and detecting basic emotional states and personality traits (i.e. forming judgmental conclusions) - is the reflective projection of our own consciousness.

Your doctor should have told you and it depends on what they were looking for. If they were only checking the tissue inside of your cervix because of an abnormal pap, you should be able to continue mild intercourse when you have no more discomfort or bleeding. If you were being checked for vaginal warts, you should wait until your results come back. Warts are infectious to your sex partner. I hope your test comes back clear. I had this done after an abnormal pap before, it can be scary. To be sure....call your doctor!
wow you should've seen me the first time my dell laptop got dirty...i tried everything\n\nif you don't want to buy anything for it, take a soft cloth and use a little bit of warm water...wipe the screen lightly from right to left starting a new row with each stroke...\n\nPS. the warm water streaks doesn't streak whereas the cold does..but don't use burning hot water\n\nhowever, if you're screen is merely dusty, theres no need to wet the cloth at all...but if it's dirty as in little specs, then wet it a little\n\nhope this helps and ur screen is squeeky clean

they're pretty similar actually...farm tenancy is a person who lives on farm land owned by a landlord. The rights the tenant has over the land, and the form of payment, varies across different systems. In some systems, he could be evicted at whim (tenancy at will); in others, he signs a contract for a fixed number of years (tenancy for years or indenture).\n\nSharecropping is actually a form of tenant farming. The people who are sharecroppers do not own any of the land they have...they basically grow items on the land and whatever profit they make off of it they give about 1/3 of it back to the owner. This practice was mostly done after the civil war when plantation owners figured this would be a good practice to make a profit and keep their land tended to without losing their help. \n\nBut anyway, I hope this little bit helps...
Where to begin?\n\nI guess first I'll say there is no such thing as "electricity", as far as some tangible resource you can store and generate. There is charge, voltage, and current, and the only one you can truly store is charge (but with charge, you can create a voltage difference, which can, in turn, create current). \n\nSecond, the link given above is to someone posting an idea they had about storing lightning with capacitors. It has not been done and, to the best of my knowledge, is unfeasible. Storing the energy (not the charge) from the lightning strike is much more feasible, but still not likely to happen for a long time. \n\nIn short, if YOU were thinking of collecting lightning, storing the charge, and then using it to power your home, you can't do it, and you'd be well advised not to try. If some brave researcher were to have been able to store a few kilojoules from a lightning strike at some point, I wouldn't be too surprised, but at this point, it's just not happening.

I dont think a relationship can work if the girl wants to be with another person - and she obviously does want to be with her bf cos she's gone back to him. AND would you really want to be with someone who is telling you that she loves you when she has a boyfriend! how could you trust her - she could be telling some other guy she loves him when she's with you?!!??

Lots. They didn't have trucks or higways back then. If farmers wanted to ship their crops to market, it had to go by riverboat or train. Towns that had railroads prospered; town's that didn't dried up and blew away.\n\nThe cattle drives that you read about were cowboys taking their cattle to rail yards in Kansas, where the cattle were shipped east to be made into steaks and shoes. Texas didn't have any railroads at first.\n\nLots of towns didn't have reliable water transportation, so they needed railroads. Just HAVING 160 (320, 640) acres of corn, wheat or barley didn't make a farmer rich; he had to ship it to market to sell it. \n\nA train could carry hundreds of times more than a horse-drawn wagon, and do it cheaper. That cut down on the transportation cost, which in turn made it economically possible to grow wheat in Nebraska and Kansas, but sell it to New York.

Since I'm a hopeless romantic...I think real love is when you can't imagine being without that special someone even for a minute, that you could be content with that person by just being in their presence, that it feels like he/she is the other half of you, that kissing and making love to that person is the best thing you ever did, etc. Love is in your very being, in your heart, in your mind. it is up to you to define it. There is a one true love that is unconditional, no matter who you are: That love is the love of Jesus Christ, your Savior.

If you don't believe in ghosts why are you asking this question? are you just trying to mock someone?\n\nWhen I was 14 I saw my cousin in the bus, he was standing when I noticed him, it was DAYTIME, and not scary at all, he was well dressed, casual. When he saw me, he ran from me, without an expresion on his face, just didn't wanna talk to me. I knew my uncle was looking for him, 'cause he wouldn't come home for almost a month, so I tryied to follow him to find out what was going on, I couldn't catch up. He had just turned 18 years old, jumped off the bus and dissapear. I couldn't see where he went.\nWhen I told my uncle, he called me away from anyone else and asked me if I was sure I saw his son, I answered a very confident "Yes". Then he told me it couldn't be possible, and after trying several more times to convince me that it could not be possible, and hear me insisting that I did saw him, when I told him the kind of clothing he was wearing, he finally said;\n"your cousin was found dead two weeks ago, I went to recognize the body and his belongings, he was killed in a fight, and the clothes you just described was what he was wearing the day he was killed".\nMy uncle added he didn't wanna tell everybody, because he knew how much we loved and admire our cousin, so he kept that from us.\nAfter that he was only seen one more time by one of his brothers, we never knew what was going on on his after life. He never talked to anyone.

It is a complicated math formula which gives points based on each aspect of a quarterback's performance ... completed passes per attempt, yards per pass attempt (not just the completions), number of touchdowns, number of interceptions.

I have M.E. I get income support (I was asked to choose between I.S and I.B- I chose the former because of the free NHS stuff). I also get DLA- middle care and high mobility. I also get blue badge/parking space at home and travel pass. \n\nAPPEAL!!! Get specialist help. A Welfare Rights Officer is who you need to see. I went to see one after being refused DLA for the third time to help me appeal and she went mad that I was refused after she read the medical report (which I requested a copy of). She also told me that the 2nd time I applied, the doctor who examined me was struck off and told me to appeal for that as well (as a late appeal). I won not only the appeal, but the backdated one too.\n\nGet to a Welfare Rights Officer now (they know what they are doing and seem to be feared by the DSS- they changed their mind about my recent appliction when I mentioned that I wanted all the info because I was going to see a Welfare Rights Officer). Its all very confusing. The DSS were at my appeal and were rude and scary and made me cry. \n\nBut just so you know, I don't think you can get Carers Allowance if you get DLA. And I hope your husband gets DLA as well as some other benefit. Not to mention a companion travel card and such, because he should. \n\nAs someone said, it is hard for the genuinely disabled due to those that just take it as an easy option or a reason not to work. Hence, perseverance shows genuine need.\n\nDon't be afraid to admit you need help and how much pain you are in. You are intitled to help. Appeal and apply for everything you can, the W.R Officer will tell you all you need to know. \n\nGood luck!
as long as you are making an effort to pay off, your credit rating should reflect that too. Good luck!

Joe Montana without a question.... but as to the QB that was great and was the most fun to watch.... that was without a doubt FRAN TARKENTON.... the sheer terror and frustration you saw in defensivemen when he got even a little light of day was truly exciting.

Most definitely not. Our government was founded on sound Christian principles. America believes strongly that anyone can come here and practice any religion freely without government involvement. Recently though, this has been true for every religion except Christianity. There is nothing wrong with having the ten commandments posted outside of government buildings and such, especially since most of us do believe that there is one God, and the ten commandments are a great moral compass (thy shalt not kill is an excellent commandment, don't you think?).

At one time, about 100 years ago, the mormon church advocated polygomy... that is having more than one wife. The mormon church no longer condones that practice. But, there are sects of the religion in the Western U.S. that still do practice polygamy. However, it is important to understand that the church they associate with does not condone their actions.

My sons had a weird schedule like this too and I'd suggest that if it doesn't bother your son, then leave it be. I don't think the school needs a bunch of parents trying to figure their system out and take up their time, that they may not have. Leave it be. If there are any quirks, the school will figure it out and fix the problem. Wait it out while they figure it out themselves. I'm sure they understand there needs to be time for the child to walk to their other classroom in between time schedules. I believe they're trying to fit classes into a system where they'll have math one morning, and then math in the afternoon another day because some kids learn better in the morning and other kids learn better in the afternoon. They're the pros, let them figure it out. You're not the one who has to follow the schedule and I bet the kids, your kid too, can and will follow it without a problem. Just hang in there and have some faith in the teachers. Good luck!
BINGO! Yes, America fits the description of the Prostitute of Babylon to a T.\n\nShe is hated by the world, including our Allies (Canada, France, and more) - The Muslims in many of these countries desire to burn America with fire (bombs, nuclear weapons, etc)\n\nAmerica is THE Epicenter of the global economy, with the United Nations and World Bank - you name it - situated in New York....\n\nShe flaunts her wealth and status of power like a brazen prostitute showing off her shame to gain attention .., many nations are corrupted by her and through her... many religions flows through her and if God viewed the Jews as prostitutes when ever they strayed to other religions - how much more does God consider a gentile nation who once embraced Christianity, then shoved God out the door for other pagan beliefs (Islam, Wicca, New age and on and on). America is the safe-haven for every conceivable religion and evil there is.

Since you asked this question in earth sciences and geology category, I will assume that you are interested in the kind of dust that gets blown around in the wind, and so forth. \nThe great volume of this dust is formed by erosion (water, wind, ice) of soil, lake beds, and rocks. Clay particles are an especially abundant component of dust--because of they can be small enough to be easily picked up by wind. But, dust can also contain anything else of the right size (small, light). USGS analysis of dust samples collected at monitoring stations shows that the African dusts can carry pesticides, heavy metals (such as mercury and arsenic), naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, pollen, insects, miscellaneous organic debris, smoke, and pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi.\nArid environments generate big dust clouds at time because there are not many plants holding the surface down. Africa and the dry parts of China, for example, may generate big plumes of dust. Known dust sources in the SW USA include dry lake (playa) surfaces and their margins, ephemeral drainage areas, poorly vegetated alluvial fans, agricultural fields, military bases, and growing urban and rural areas. \n\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/dust/\nhttp://health.usgs.gov/inhalation/african_dust.html\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/sw/monitor/dust.html

To succeed in a case such as this three things must be shown: There was a duty of care owed, this duty of care was breached and the damage resulted from that breach. All employers owe a duty of care to their employees, in the U.K this includes adequate training, supervision and competent colleagues. Provided he was actually an employee and not a contractor or self employed then a duty of care can be presumed and in this case the remaining two conditions will be fulfilled. \n\nI am presuming that your solicitor will be suing in Tort (negligence). I remember a few years ago, there was a book which detailed what one would receive for a certain injury, I'll see if I can dig it out to give you an idea so check back in a few days. The amount you will receive in damages depends on a number of different factors though and is subject to enhancement or reduction for several reasons, i.e the severity of the damage and the impact this will have on his daily life etc and also whether the employer manages to atribute any contributory negligence to your husband. Your husband should also receive any back pay which he may be owed as a result of missing work and any other out of pocket expenses (i.e. travel costs for hospital appointments).

This follow-up appeared the next day, Sept. 13, 1986. \n\nDOGTOWN TALES: \n\nSeems as if we'll never know for sure how our Dogtown got its name, but we certainly do have some good stories about its origin; it could be there's a goodly portion of truth in them all. Yesterday we covered the dog eaters from the World's Fair, but today we'll go back before the fair, to 1876. That's when, according to the 1937 History of Cheltenham and St. James Parish penned by the Rev. P.J. O'Connor, the area got its name "from squatters who built shacks in the neighborhood of Graham and West Park after they were evicted from Forest Park." And that's the extent of what this extensive volume on the area had to say about Dogtown. But we've unearthed yet another source for the name Dogtown, which goes back to the 1890s. That very believeable story will be told, possibly for the first time in print, on Monday.

Hi Chris, thanks for your question, which connects future clean energy solutions with the power of photosynthesis. I am an inventor working on just such technology, which is called SolaRoof and is a global, OpenSource system for construction of living structures for homes and communities. Our goal is a transition to a sustainable EcoLiving lifestyle that is powered by the "BlueGreen" concepts of water working and living plants. In our transparent SolaRoof buildings we can use plants and algae to grow Biomass from which we can produce biofuels and nutrients for growing organic food is an important know how for sustainable living. For more information enter the KeyWords above (WikiWords) in our search box at the SolaRoof Wiki. Also, search OilFromAlgae at our Wiki and you will see that we are also hosting an sub-wiki on this particular subject. Algae is very important because its' high rate of growth can actually satisfy our demand for liquid fuel. We are just getting started on the OilFromAlgae and invite help and participation.

In VB.Net it is easy enough - there's a huge namespace devoted to fonts, that lets you bring in fonts temporarily. I think because of the callbacks, needed, etc. That is probably how you'd want to work.\n\nDo a .NET dll - create a method that working with System.Drawing.Fonts brings in your font temporarily. Then put your DLL in the Gac and register it in COM. Call your .NET DLL from VB6.\n\nYour other option - and it might work - is on your VB6 app's form load event, copy the TTF file for the Arabic font into c:&#92;windows&#92;system&#92;fonts - a little less robust since you kind of have to hope you have permissions to do so, but most times it will work...

There are 2 ways to achieve that:\n1. Use percent values instead of fixed units(px, pt etc). \nGood point: This way your website will always be proportioned the same way in any resolution.\nBad point: You may experience inappropriate display, if the resolution is too big, or to small.\n\n2. Make different sets of templates for each resolution from 800x600, to 1600x1200, put a JS on your index page, that will detect users resolution, and serve the right template.\n\nGood Point: Your webpage will look as desired.\nBad Point: Some users keep their JS browser options disabled, therefore you won't be able to detect and serve the right template. It also implies a lot more work, than option no. 1

It's an overreaction. Let people choose to do what they want as long as it doesn't affect you personally.\n\nA good example of this can be found in a town where I went to college. Some in the public and the local government wanted all pornography to be removed and banned. This pornography sat behind store counters or behind doors clearly marked as adults only. For some reason, certain people were still offended by it even though they couldn't see it and it wasn't being pushed on them. They weren't going to be satisfied until all traces of it were obliterated. You have a choice: if something bothers you, don't involve yourself with it. Those who wish to walk that road, leave them alone. Sounds simple, but this debate will continue for ever. As long as someone is doing something that someone else doesn't like, regardless of whether or not they can see it, people will continue to fight what they can't see until there is nothing left or the offended party ceases to exist.\n\nAND JIMMY R IS CORRECT: PEOPLE ARE FANATICAL ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CONTRASTS THEIR RELIGION...JUST LOOK AT THE FANATICS WITHIN THE MUSLIM RELIGION CONTINUING TO PUSH VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.

Your startup costs will depend on several factors:\n\n- cost of lease in your area\n- size of the space you will be leasing for the bookstore\n- leasehold improvements\n- initial store facilities\n- initial inventory\n- equipment (credit card terminals, security alarms, etc)\n- insurance\n- legal (permits, licenses, lawyer to help with legal structure)\n- presale marketing and advertising\n\nThe space and improvements will be your biggest expense. One of my clients started a bookstore in the Washington DC area last year, and her startup costs reached as high as $128,000. If you live in an area with lower cost of living, you may be able to start with lower amounts.\n\nOne resource I highly recommend is the Christian Booksellers Association http://www.cbaonline.org/ In July there is an International Christian Retail Show http://www.christianretailshow.com/ that you may want to check out

X = Y^2 is not a function. It fails the vertical line test. You cannot graph it on a graphing calculator. (At least not a TI-86.)\n\nYou need to break it into two pieces that don't have multiple y values per x value. In this case, x = y^2 breaks nicely into \ny = square root of x\nand y = - square root of x\n\nAs far as I know, you can't graph X as a function to Y on any TI graphing calculators, but I only know up to the TI-89. You can simulate a graph of a f(y) = x equation but you have to convert it into a piecewise function.

Evidently, the Dell rep is new, because although Lexmark makes Dell printers, the cartridges are not compatible.\n\nLexmark cartridges will likely fit into your Dell printer. However, the little microchip located on your Lexmark cartridges is different than the microchip located on your Dell printer. In other words, it will fit, but your printer will not recognize it. I would call and complain to Dell customer support. \n\nBecause Lexmark is rated as one of the most unreliable printers (see PC Magazine's recent annual printer review) and also because you absolutely have to order Dell ink online for your printer, many people trash their Dell printer and buy a different brand. I recommend this to you. \n\nThe same issue of PC Magazine I mentioned earlier named Canon and HP the two most reliable printers. And besides, ink for the two brands (especially HP) can be easily found. I own the HP Photosmart C5180 and have never owned a better printer than this, but if you don't do as many photos, look into the C4180 (or C4140 at Wal Mart).
Its fiction but its very interesting you should give it a read, it does seem so real and i had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't - i think it offends some catholics but i'm a catholic and wasnt offended its very entertaining.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is a novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 2003 by Doubleday Fiction (ISBN 0385504209). It is a worldwide bestseller with 36 million copies in print (as of August 2005) and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy theory genres, the book is part two of a trilogy that started with Brown's 2000 novel Angels and Demons, which introduced the character Robert Langdon. In November 2004, Random House published a "Special Illustrated Edition", with 160 illustrations interspersed with the text.\n\nThe plot of the novel involves a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the true story of Jesus. This implies that the Vatican consciously knows it is living a lie, but does so to keep itself in power. The novel has helped generate popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity. Fans have lauded the book as creative, action-packed and thought-provoking. Critics have attacked it as inaccurate and poorly written, and decry the many negative implications about the Christian Church.\n\nThe book opens with the claim by Dan Brown that "all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate"; but this claim is disputed by academic scholars in the fields the book discusses (see Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code and the further reading list below). As widely noted in the media, there has been substantial confusion among readers about whether the book is factual.

The flag, called "Tae Kuk," symbolizes the thought, philosophy, and mysticism of the Far East. \n\nThe circle in the center, red upper half and blue lower half, represents absolute, or the essential unity of all being. The Yang (positive) and the Yin (negative) divisions within the circle represent duality. Examples of duality are heaven and hell, fire and water, life and death, good and evil, or night and day \n\nThe four trigrams also indicate the duality of opposites and balances. In the upper left trigram, three unbroken lines symbolize Heaven; opposite them in the lower right, three broken lines represent Earth. In the upper right trigram, two broken lines separated by an unbroken line is the symbol of Water; opposite them is Fire, symbolized by two unbroken lines separated by a broken line. \n\nSymbolic of the nation is the white background (the land), the circle (people), and the four trigrams (the government). All three make up the essential elements of the nation.

Evidence for evolution:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n3. The fossil record.\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n6. Genetic analysis shows similarities among species reflecting evolutionary origins.\n7. Homologous structures.\n8. Many cellular and biochemcial processes are conserved in a variety of species.\n9. Vestigical biochemical pathways (for example, pancreatic cells are light-sensitive even though they are located deep inside the body).\n\nThose are just a few off the top of my head. If you'd like to know more about any of them, just ask.\n\nEvidence for intelligent design:\nUmm... the bible says so?\n\nI think the choice is clear. It's not a question of "belief," but rather of rational thought, reasoning, and examination of evidence.\n\n\n_______________\nResponse to johnblessed01:\n\nFirst, I did not state that each of the points taken own its own is irrefutable proof of evolution. I said that each of those constitutes evidence that evolution occurs. While no one point proves evolution, taken in combination the body of scientific evidence that supports evolution is quite strong.\n\nNow to address the individual arguments:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n\nWhere did I saw that the human tail bone is the best example of a vestigial structure? I'm not an expert on human anatomy, but I will not deny that the tail bone has a structural function in the human body.\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans in the appendix. It has no function. Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix). An appendix is found in several mammals. In humans it is small and has no known function. In rabbits and many other herbivours it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hip bones of snakes. Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrutions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nI didn't say that microevolution proves macroevolution. However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible. On its own microevolution is not terribly compelling for the reasons johnblessed01 described. However, taken in context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanims by which macroevolution could occur. On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\njohnblessed01's response to this point demonstrated a lack of understanding of the processes involved in fossilization and the methods associated with reconstructing evolutionary history. Obviously the "geological column" is a simplification. Scientists can reconstruct a sequence of events based on the types of surrounding rocks (I'm not an expert in geology but a geologist could explain in great detail how different types of rocks form), carbond dating, and various other methods.\n\nGeologists can distinguish sedemntary layers formed rapidly by a volcano from layers formd by, for example, changing bodies of water and low-acting forces of nature. But again, this is not the only method of dating fossiles.\n\nThe time scale under which fossilization takes place depends on the geological and environmental conditions. These can be assessed based on the chemical composition of the fossile and the surrounding material, as well as other factors. Petrification can occur extremely rapidly in, say, a bog or a tar pit, but not at the bottom of

Hey! All you hamsters out there? Are you gonna answer or what?
You are correct. The tracks are powered by cogged wheels driven by the engine and work like the wheels of a car except they run along the track instead of the road bed. Look at the wheel when it is moving. The bottom point is momentarily fixed to the ground and the top point is moving straight ahead with a momentary velocity. The axel which is half way between the top and bottom is traveling at the average velocity:\n\nVelocity (axel) = (Vtop + Vbottom)/ 2 = (Vtop + 0)/2 = 1/2 Vtop\n\nThe machine moves at the speed of the axel; proving your point.\n\nAn even better illusion is the fact that when a locomotive speeds down a track, part of it is always moving backwards (hint: the part of the wheel flanges below the top surface of the track!).

What do you mean by shorts out?\n\ndo you mean that there is an actual electrical short, or that the sound cuts out every now and then?\n\nif the first, and there is a wiring problem, then it is because wire have come loose and are touching other exposed wires. you can take off the cover (depending on the make and model of guitar, you may have to go in through the pick ups) and find the loose wire(s) and solder them. \n\nor, simply take the guitar to a guitar shop and have them look at it.\n\nit could be anywhere. in the guitar if this happens, but if it does, the guitar will most likely not work after the first time it does.\n\nIf it is the second, and the guitar cuts out every now and then while playing, it can be a few things.\n\none-the output jack that you plug the cable into is loose, and can be fixed with solder.\n\ntwo- the cable itself is shot, and should be replaced. you can troubleshoot this by pluging the guitar into the amp with another cord.\n\nthree-if you are using a pedal, try bypassing the pedal, just connect the guitar right into the amp. and see if that changes anything, it may be a loose wire in the pedal.\n\nor, maybe the 9volt in the guitar is old, and can be replaced.

They can be used (practically) for taking measurements. They also crop up in periodic motion and lots of other areas of mathematics. They are functions of angles. \n\nIt is simplest to see from a right triangle ABC, where the angle B is the 90 degree angle. In this angle the length of the side AB might be called a, the length of the side BC might be called b and the length of the side CA might be called c. (draw it out.)\n\n\nSide c is the hypotenuse.\n\n For angle A, the Opposite side is b. For Angle A, the Adjacent side is a.\n\nFor Angle C, the opposite side is a, the Adjacent side is b.\n\nGiven this triangle, \nthe sin(A) = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b/c.\ncos(A) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = a/c.\ntan(A) = sin(A)/cos(A) = b/a = Opposite/Adjacent.\n\n\nIf you're measuring height of a building and know how far you are from the building (adjacent side) and the angle you must look up to see the top edge of the building, tou can use (adjacent*tan(angle looking up)) = height of building.

You have to really think about this question. Have you ever been in a waiting room in a radiology department/facility? Have you seen all the pregnant women sitting there, waiting for their ultrasounds? Did you ever think this was a health risk for them?\n\nAny room that is used to take x-rays is shielded with lead in the walls. You could be on the other side of a wall that x-rays were directed at and have no measurable dose. You could be in a bathroom that shares a wall with a x-ray room and get no dose. The x-ray room is completely shielded so radiation cannot pass through it. Don't you think x-ray workers would all be dying of cancer, or at least all have cataracts if this wasn't the case?\n\nHave you ever had a loved one in the ICU? We also do x-rays in surgery and the emergency department. We do x-rays on portable machines on a regular basis. If you are not right in the path of the x-ray beam, and if you are not close to that path, there is no exposure. X-rays do not travel for eternity...they dissipate. \n\nThe use of x-rays and the rules that surround them are above and beyond what is necessary to protect the public. These things are tested on an annual basis. If we don't pass, we don't do x-rays anymore. \n\nSo, you should feel safe living next to an imaging center.
Yes, definitely. Comedians can do skits that are hysterical and appropriate when new, but 10, 20 years later the jokes are not funny. Why? Because the times have changed, people have changed (and aged). It's like music - a hit is a great song for awhile. The hit didn't change, but the people/times have. To stay (or get back on the charts), the song needs to be updated, as does the comedian's jokes, if he wants to stay on top.\n\nAn example of how times have changed, might be George Carlin's "Seven Words" skit. There "were" seven words that could not be used on television [Da*n, f*ck, he*l...]. But now, a lot of those words are used without hesitating or censorship, and the skit is not funny (unless you remember those days - or Carlin changes his skit to reflect the difference between then and now -- which he has, I believe).

Internships would be a great asset to your school record, could connect you to people who can write those very important college recommendation letters and can give you some incite into where a career in physics could lead.

Often you will see flyers for visiting speakers, public lectures and all sorts of events that could connect you with people that can give you guidance and advice.

I think the kind of christians he is refering to are those who are born in a country where christianity is the state relgion and you are automatically born as a christian like Finland etc. So there you will find many people who are regestered as christians but who are actually athiests or only visit the church when its for their own convenience or when there is some special function like christmas etc. Also these kinds of christians like to visit churches only on sunday to confess their sins because they feel guilty for all the shameful activities they have done during the past week.\n\nIn every religion you will find sincere followers and those who follow just for the sake of following. And because Christianity is the biggest world religion you find more of these kind of people. By percentage I cant say though...

Yes, it happens. But I've found the "cheap" rings usually mean more than the expensive ones.\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we were poor college students with no jobs so he couldn't afford an engagement ring. On our honeymoon, we went to a small antique store and saw a beautiful ring -- it was bright green crystal set in sterling silver -- and it was $10. The man we bought it from warned it was expensive. Since my husband had $10, he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my "very expensive ring". Although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor, I love that ring and will never get another one. For me, it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world.
Is it supposed to say it is thrown from an initial height of 5 feet? The path of the ball will be in the form of a parabola y=ax^2 + bx + c where\n\na = 1/2 the force of gravity (gravity is -32 feet/second^2, so -16 feet/second^2)\nx = time, so in this case 2\nb = the velocity\nc = the initial starting height\n\nSo just plug in your numbers and solve\n\n= -16*(2^2) + 35*2 + 5\n= -64 + 70 + 5\n= 11 feet\n\nOh, and the function would be h(t) = -16t^2 + 35t + 5

Getting on the pill is the best way to ensure a regular period. It is also great for helping with premenstal discomforts. Irregular periods are much more common than you probably think. So many things can affect it, such as: stress, excessive exercise, change in eating or sleeping habits. Talk to your gyno. One more thing, being that your pretty young, your county health department most likely offers free birth control based on your income. Check it out you have nothing to lose!

as a past sufferer of TMJ I can tell ya this. If you grind your teeth, have the clicking, get the headaches you most likely need an appliance made for your mouth. You can get one for sleep only or 24/7. I know you said you don't have a dentist but is that because insurance doesn't cover one? I have heard that TMJ can sometimes be covered under medical because of the symptoms.\nIf neither are an option if you want you can do this to help the pain. Put a pencil or bic pen in your mouth. Lay the pen on the rear molar, lightly bite down. Doing this separates the lower mandibular from your skull. This gives the disc an opportunity to return to it proper space. Releasing the nerves that your are pressing on.\ngood luck! but you really need this piece made for your mouth.
hey, don't freak out! If I had a penny for every friend of mine that wanted to (or did) experiment with someone of the same sex, I'd have a penny from every friend. Not even kidding. I'm gay myself, so many people feel comfortable telling me when they want to dip their big toe in the gay pool, so to speak. Sometimes it's because a girl is just sick of men altogether, sometimes they're in your situation, sometimes they just want to try something new... the reasons are limitless and all are totally rational. I'm guessing that because this is a friend of yours that you are not gay... being attracted to a friend of any sex in normal, even I find myself having temporary attractions for my girlfriends.... but always temporary. If this attraction persists and grows stronger, then I would encourage you to pursue it.. although I'm not sure whether your friend is gay or bi or what. Tell her what you're feeling as long as it wont freak her out. maybe get some advice from your closest friends. If you continue to feel this way about other girls too, then you may be gay and that's okay.. it's a scary thought I know, but once you know who you like you'll learn to love who you are. fact. But if I gave a penny for every friend who wanted to experiment and ended up gay, I'd probably only have to give up a couple, if that. Do what feels right...that's my philosophy. ♡\nI hope I could help!!

my philosphy is to each his own =)\n\nThe English word "Taoism" is used to translate the Chinese terms Daojiao (道教) and Daojia (道家). The character Tao 道 (or Dao, depending on the Romanisation scheme one prefers) literally means "path" or "way", but in Chinese religion and philosophy has taken on more abstract meanings. The compound Daojiao refers to Daoism as a religion (i.e., people worshipping at altars); Daojia refers to the activity of scholars in their studies. It must be noted that this distinction is itself controversial and fraught with hermeneutic difficulty.\n\nMuch uncertainty exists over the meaning of "Taoism". In some countries and contexts (for example, the national "Taoism" organisations of China and Taiwan), the label has come to be applied to the Chinese folk religion, which would otherwise not have a readily recognisable English name. However many, if not most, of its practitioners would not recognise "Taoism" (in any language) as the name of their religion. Moreover, the several forms of what we might call "elite" or "organised" Taoism often distinguish their ritual activities from those of the folk religion, which some professional "Taoists" (Daoshi) tend to view as debased.\n\nChinese alchemy, astrology, cuisine, several Chinese martial arts, Chinese traditional medicine, fengshui, and many styles of qigong breath training disciplines have some relationship with Taoism.

That's not true, a good example was at my auntie's wedding a couple of years back. At the dinner she stood up and gave a speech on 'first impressions not being the last impressions' saying that when she first met her husband, she thought he was boring and dry and she couldn't stand him. Then after knowing him a couple of months, she fell in love.\nThe only time that this statement is true, is when you meet a person and don't meet them again for say two or three years or never meet them again, then you will only have that one impression to base them on.
its called ignorance.
We can see part of the Milky Way in the night sky, but what it looks like is a band of stars since we are seeing it from the "side". There isn't an actual picture of the Milky Way from the "top", so the pictures you see are really simulations or projections based on what we know... We can make a good guess of what it looks like since we know the distances to many of the stars within our galaxy, and if we start plotting them, we can make an estimate of what our galaxy must look like from afar. There's a great drawing of what some leading astronomers now think the Milky Way looks like: http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050825.html\n\nOn your question about planets, we can actually see all of the planets we know of with telescopes (on earth and in space... like the hubble telescope). But some of the really distant planets are still hard to see from earth. But we've also sent out several deep space probes that have passed nearby most the planets where we've been able to take great pictures.

When was 911 "invented?" The simple answer is: over 35 years ago. However, the development of the three-digit number in the United States is slightly more complex than a single date. Here is a summary of how it was implemented for the first time in the United States, and events leading up to that historic event.\n\nBy the way, this collection of material was prompted by Reba Fitzgerald, who contacted me after the death of her husband in June 2001: it was Robert Fitzgerald and his colleagues who implemented the first 911 system in Haleyville (Ala.) in 1968. Ms. Fitzgerald spent the last year of her life working to set the record straight, and then no doubt satisfied she had accomplished some measure of success, died in August 2002.\n\nThere is no debate on where the first 911 call was placed. However, there is considerable unverifiable information about who was involved and how 911 was developed. We have investigated the genesis of the first 911 system, and present here the first accurate, documented history of 911, including key dates, whether we've confirmed the event with documentation from the time (not from later recollections), and the details of the event. E-mail us if you have confirming documentation for events without a check mark, or if you have corrections/updates--check below for the missing information we need verified. We hope this account will finally give credit to those whose imagination and spirit helped create the invaluable resource of 911.\n\n\n \nFriday,\nMarch 10, 1876\n\nOK, this may be pushing history a bit too far, but.....Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call for help during testing of his gear. Bell reportedly dropped some battery acid on his clothes and said those famous words, "Mr. Watson, come here. I want you!" His assistant, Thomas A. Watson, heard the words over the set-up they were testing and came to his aid. \n\nThursday,\nJuly 8, 1937\n \n Britain implements its 999 emergency telephone system serving police, fire and EMS after phone calls were delayed reporting 5-fatality fire on Wimpole Street. The first 999 call was placed at 4:20 a.m. when the wife of John Stanley Beard (33 Elsworthy Rd., Hampstead, London) dialed 999 to report a burglar outside her home. The burglary, 24 yeard-old Thomas Duffys, was apprehended. \n\n1957\n\n The National Association of Fire Chiefs reportedly suggests a single number for reporting fires.\n \nSept. 1958\n\n New Zealand debuts their 111 emergency number. \nJune 21, 1959 According to the Winnipeg (Man.) Police Department Web site, North America's first 999 system was introduced in that city, and the operation's first supervisor was Helen Aizita Woollard. There were initially eight Emergency Telephone Operators, of which Lucienne Galinas was one of the original hires. Canada converted its three-digit emergency number to 911 in 1972. Check this CBC video about the center. \n\n1961 \n\nAustralia introduces its 000 emergency number in metropolitan areas of the country. \n\nFebruary., 1967\n \n President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice issues its report, recommending that police departments have a single number to call, and that eventually that single number should be used nationwide. (see Alan Burton's account.). The report stated, "The Commission recommends: Wherever practical, a single police telephone number should be established, at least within a metropolitan area and eventually over the entire United States, comparable to the telephone company's long-distance information number." The recommendation was based on input from the Commission's Task Force on Science and Technology [see June 3, 1967 entry] \n\nMay 23, 1967 \n\nIndiana Rep.

Peaceful populations require force ratios of somewhere between one and four police officers per thousand residents. The United States as a whole has about 2.3 sworn police officers per thousand residents. Larger cities tend to have higher ratios of police to population.
Ok well the first thing to remember is that temperature is really just a measure of the kinetic energy in a material. That is, how fast the particles are moving.\n\nIn a cold material the atoms are moving about very slowly, but as the temperature increases the speed and energy of the particles increases. \n\nNow diffusion can be said to be the rate at which particles mix with each other or the rate at which they intermingle through random thermal motion. Obviously if they are moving faster, they will mix faster. And if they are moving slow they will mix slow.\n\nAs an example think of a jar of different colour sand layers, if you shake the jar slowly the sands will mix slowly, but if you shake it very fast the sands will mix very quickly. Same thing with molecules.

Stocks are quoted with bid and ask prices. \n\nIf you place a small market order to buy, you will get filled near the ask. If you place a small market order to sell you will get filled near the bid. Market orders execute at the best market price going.\n\nWith a limit order you specify a maximum price you will pay or minimum price you will sell for. You might not get filled with a limit order.\n\nIf you really want to buy at the market, place a limit order 5 or 10 cents above the ask. Do the same below the bid if you want to sell. This way, if there is a moment of illiquidity, you're not getting filled at some outrageous price.

I have about $10,000 but it's in a no-interest credit card, at least for 12 months.

But things were pretty scary there for a bit.
Yes, it's true. Developing dark skin was nature's way of providing more protection from the sun's rays. That's why people tan, it's to help protect the skin. Light skin burns easily. Light eyes are more sensitive to bright light. Have you also noticed that most black americans are not real dark like true africans? They aren't exposed to that harsh sun anymore and have lightened up. I'm not sure about the hair "curling up from steam" it sounds reasonable, but actually, straight hair when seen under a microscope is round like a pencil, and tight curly hair is flatter like a ruler. Soft curly hair is oval shaped. It's the follicles that determine curly or straight. But hey, it might have originated that way from heat, I don't know.\nps. I think brown skin and green eyes are gorgeous, and also shiny black hair with ice blue eyes too. It's different.

Different browsers render a little differently. Some html is not recognized by all browsers. It is very common for sites to not render correctly in Firefox because it is less tolerant to errors in the html. Most likely, the code was not written well or not written to accommodate browsers other than IE that don't recognize certain pieces of html code that IE does. I can't even access the sites I have to use in my job from Firefox. They don't play well together.\n\nNot all webpages should show up poorly, though.

Yes, you can still pass on an STD that is "dormant". Test results may or may not come out negative, depending upon several factors. For example, you can pass on herpes or syphilis even when they're not in active stages, because the agents that cause these diseases "hide out" in the body for periods of time without causing obvious symptoms. Herpes lives in part of the spinal cord forever...once you've been infected, you remain that way for life. It is possible to pass it on to someone else even if you don't have an outbreak. In the case of syphilis, these days it can be cured with certain antibiotics...but when the disease runs its natural course, there is often a latent period between the primary stage and the secondary one, as well as between the secondary and tertiary stages. It is still possible to spread this disease, too, even during the latent periods.

But so many idiots try to take advantage so I put magickal shields around me ...it bounces off me and goes back on them! \nThe other thing is that so many women say they want a nice guy but are attracted to the proverbial "bad boys." Its time ladies to take stock of that! The bad boys are going to be bad to you too...eventually, not at first while they're still lusting strong for you...but after a few years of marriage...you go way down on their list! ladies you need to rationalize that and give up that bad boy attraction. When I did, I began to recognize all those wonderful loving nice guys around...previously they were invisible to me. Then I married one great nice sweet guy...not a bad guy...but a really nice one. And we live happily ever after now more than 11 years! Try it you'll like it. I think it is all part of our cultural stuff here.
Basic Answer \nThe circumference of the Earth at the equator is 25,000 miles. The Earth rotates in about 24 hours. Therefore, if you were to hang above the surface of the Earth at the equator without moving, you would see 25,000 miles pass by in 24 hours, at a speed of 25000/24 or just over 1000 miles per hour. \n\nMultiply by cosine of your latitude to see how fast the Earth is rotating where you are. \n\nEarth is also moving around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour. \n\nAdvanced Answer \n\nIf by "turning" you mean the rotation of the Earth about its axis (where axis just means the straight line between the North and South poles) it is quite easy to figure out how fast any part of the Earth's surface is moving. \n\nThe Earth rotates once in a few minutes under a day (23 hours 56 minutes 04. 09053 seconds). This is called the sidereal period (which means the period relative to stars). The sidereal period is not exactly equal to a day because by the time the Earth has rotated once, it has also moved a little in its orbit around the Sun, so it has to keep rotating for about another 4 minutes before the Sun seems to be back in the same place in the sky that it was in exactly a day before. \n\nAn object on the Earth's equator will travel once around the Earth's circumference (40,075.036 kilometers) each sidereal day. So if you divide that distance by the time taken, you will get the speed. An object at one of the poles has hardly any speed due to the Earth's rotation. (A spot on a rod one centimeter in circumference for example, stuck vertically in the ice exactly at a pole would have a speed of one centimeter per day!). The speed due to rotation at any other point on the Earth can be calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude of the point. (If you are not familiar with cosines, I wouldn't worry about that now, but if you can find a pocket calculator which has a cosine button you might like to try taking the cosine of your own latitude and multiplying that by the rotation speed at the equator to get your own current speed due to rotation!). \n\nThe Earth is doing a lot more than rotating, although that is certainly the motion we notice most, because day follows night as a result. We also orbit the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is about 940 million kilometers, so if you divide that by the hours in a year you will get our orbital speed in kilometers per hour. We are also moving with the Sun around the center of our galaxy and moving with our galaxy as it drifts through intergalactic space!
We live life in order to make the decision to follow God, through Jesus Christ. That is my opinion as a Christian. I feel that we are supposed to bring as many people as possible with us to Heaven and to live as good a life as possible. We are called to strive for perfection, even though we can never attain it in this world. We have no idea what we will know or remember when we die. We will know our loved ones, but we will not cry. It may be that just the bad memories are taken away. I can't presume what Heaven will be like, but it is supposed to be better than this world can ever be. It is perfect. Blessings to you and good luck in your search.

MLM is legal because there is actually a product involved. It's basically where you buy something from a distributor and then distribute it to someone else who distributes it again, and so on. Eventually someone buys and consumes the products. It's similar to all normal commerce, but the reason nobody makes any money is that after a few levels, there are so many middlemen marking it up that there is no more room to price it much higher and actually sell it. That's why they tell you to sell to friends and family, because they are more sympathetic and are willing to pay more to be nice.\n\nPonzi as I understand it just involves sending money to people, and then getting other people to send money to you AND the people above you for a few levels, and then those people get even more people to send money to them and you, etc. There is no actual commerce involved, and it is mathematically guaranteed to fail after some number of levels.\n\n"Pyramid scheme" is usually used synonymously with the Ponzi scheme, and they are all illegal except for the Federal Reserve and Social Security systems.
Electromagnetic resonance stimulation (eMRS) speeds up the breakdown of lactate, the rapid removal of lactic acid.\nThis means the typical pain disappears more quickly.\n\neMRalso accelerates cell regenration by stimulating metabolism, so that training intervals can be shortened in top-class sport.\nPromotion of circulaton counteracts wear on the joints.\nThe warm-up program stimulates the cell metabolism so that the cells are prepared for performance. Pulled muscles and tendons can thus be avoided

1. This message occurs when a subaddress is configured. When this subaddress is combined with the X.121 address of the interface, the total address exceeds the limit of 15 characters.\n\n2. The X.25 configuration of the interface is not valid. The existing configuration was not changed.\n\n3. You have attempted an invalid configuration.\n\n4. A virtual circuit has been set up using the default maximum packet sizes, but the data terminal equipment (DTE) and data communications equipment (DCE) are not configured with the same default values. A packet was received that had the M-bit set, signifying that more data follows, but the packet did not carry the maximum number of bytes allowed. Such partial data packets must have the M-bit cleared. The resulting loss of a message boundary might cause problems for the data recipient.\n\n5. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n6. A stacker compression algorithm internal error or a shortage of buffer space was encountered during a compression operation.\n\nNote: This error should never happen.\n\n7. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n8. You have used an invalid configuration ID.\n\n9.

Manifold is a Germanic/Old English word that means, simply, "many folds." In today's language, it generally means many folds, forms, or features. I would say the two uses of the word you mentioned are both perfectly reasonable. Exhaust manifolds are structures that have multiple inlets/outlets (hence, many features). In topology, manifolds are, in general, surfaces with many features.
I'll assume you are referring to plate tectonics. Another name for a convergent boundary is "convergent plate boundary." This type of plate interaction can also be termed "active margin." More inforamtion about convergent boundaries can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary

Take one day at a time, and don't worry about the future. Unless he is not willing to have kids with you, then you shouldn't worry about the age differnce. If he doesn't want kids, and you do, then I think you need to decide which is more important to you, your boyfriend, or children. For now enjoy your relationship, and take it day by day.
I know this is strange but, this is the best way to describe it: A wonderful pressure builds up inside you. When it lets go..it feels like a good sneeze. You know, the tickle, the anticipation of a sneeze,, then..ACHOOO!! You feel better? An orgasm feels like a sneeze between your legs.

That truely sounds like a question that you should be answering your doctor. I don't think you can, but its always better to take precautions just in case. I know a guy that was 98% sterile and he still got his girlfriend pregnant.
What makes you think you have a second copy? The prompt you get? This means nothing. It could be the same copy.\n\nfrom a command prompt, type:\nECHO %WINDIR%\n\nThat is your Windows directory. DO NOT DELETE IT. Boot to the other install and do the same thing. If both say C:&#92;WINDOWS then you DO NOT have two copies of windows, you just have a boot.ini file that lists Windows twice.\n\nIf you DO have two copies of Windows, then boot into the one you want and delete the folder of the other, as determined by that ECHO %WINDIR% command before.\n\nThen type NOTEPAD C:&#92;BOOT.INI\n\nLook at the lines there - it should look something like this:\n[boot loader]\ntimeout=30\ndefault=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)&#92;WINDOWS\n[operating systems]\nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)&#92;WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP Professional" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect\nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)&#92;WINXP="Microsoft Windows XP Professional" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect\n\nNote the name following ..(1)&#92; - WINDOWS is what you will probably see. If there's another entry, then post it here and no one will see it because most people stop looking at these questions after they answer them. So as an alterntive, use a site like www.experts-exchange.com or www.tek-tips.com to ask this question and people will actually have the opportunity to interact with you and help solve the problem.
She might need to be on insulin and/or medications to control her Blood Sugar Level (BSL) adequately - its especially so in case of Diabetes in young people. \n\nIt is very important to have strict control of the BSL. Without adequate control, many of the body's organs start getting damaged within a few years- these include the eyes, kidneys, limbs and the nervous system. Eventually the damage may become very severe and it may lead to blindness and the person may need to be on dialysis for life.\n\nBut with a good control over the BSL right from the beginning, a person can lead a virtually normal and healthy life. One may need to bring about a few lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet control too, but doing so ensures a complication free life.\n\nSo make your friend understand this point that although Diabetes has severe complications, with strict BSL control and routine check-ups, one can delay or even prevent most of these complications. Once the damage is done, it cannot be reversed. \n\nSo better to be safe than sorry... get her to visit her doc- he/she will explain in greater detail about this.

The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate produced in the glycolysis is first decarboxylated to yield acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to yield citrate. Citrate is then converted to isocitrate. Isocitrate is then converted to a-ketoglutarate (first CO2 is lost and the first NADH is produced). A-keto is converted to succinyl-CoA (CO2 produced). At this point the rest of the cycle is to regenerate oxaloacetate. The succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate (producing GTP) which is converted to fumarate (produces FADH2). Fumarate is converted to Malate and finally to Oxaloacetate (NADH produced). Krebs cycle produces a total of 1 GTP, 1 FADH2 and 3 NADH. The FADH2 and NADH enter the electron transport chain. For each molecule of glucose there will be 2 turns of the cycle.
Point taken...There is ONLY one member of Congress that has a child and Iraq..but I can't remember his name. Any leader should use that as a yard stick...Is the cause worth my own child's life?\n From what I have seen EVERYTHING about Iraq from beginning to end as been a huge and costly mistake.
Good one, man! I love it!

It depends on your broadband provider. You want to ask them if they support POP3/SMTP email. Some do, but some only offer access to their email systems through the web (from their standpoint, it is a lot easier to maintain security that way). Check with their support department or website.\n\nI hope that helps. Again, if you provide some more information about who you are using as an Internet provider, we could offer more help.

Yes I did say this. I don't think there is anything wrong with speaking about death as far as children are concerned. Death is a part of life and it is only scary if you do not bring God into their life to balance it with hope. Children already in this day and age know about death what they don't know about is God. More children today should pray this prayer. Death should not be swept under the carpet because it happens to everyone.

You heard alot about it, because "they" are preparing you for it. Who are they? Well, the real leaders are the ones we don't see. It won't be a good thing when this happens. But it will happen. They have been preparing us for it, and testing it out for a while now. It is a power hunger thing, not a " I care about the world thing". How can we have peace in a world that doesn't agree. Simply answer, kill the ones who don't believe what you believe :)\n Sounds crazy. \n\nWatch out for "CHIPS IMPLANTED INTO HUMANS", so they can track you down easier, and identify you easier. They can tract you down now, but if you don't use a cell phone or a credit card or a store card. It is not easy. Luckily for them, most of us do. Cash is starting to be rare now adays. But that was part of the whole plan. Watch out for " THE ONE CARD TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING", it will sound like the easiest thing for you and me. Because thats how they will promote it, with a positive outlook. For your benefit of chorse. \n\nWatch out: When the Nuclear bomb drops, (and it will drop). It will be to bring down the population to a more controlled level. How can one take over the world if you have to many people on it. It only makes sense. The wars, they keep having, is so slow. The dieases they throw out their, takes too long, the world of "unhealthy eating, living habits" are starting to take a turn. People start to educate themselves. This is a problem for them.\n\nWell, don't be a fool. But some will unfortunately, that is what they want. By the way, did you know that Hilter used FLORIDE on the Jews as a mind control. Funny, how "they put it in are water and they say its for our teeth", so we drink floride, when it is not natural for our bodies for the reason of are teeths. I thought their was floride in toothpaste. I guess, they want to make if your kids don't sollow enough during brushing their teeth, they will get them another way. If a tube of tooth paste will kill a 2 year old. What will a small amount do? Well, its not like they don't put the warning on the back of it.\n\nIn the end, the bible prophesys about a one world government, A False Jesus with many miracles before the real Jesus Comes Back. So watch out. It is the Last Days. Only Jesus can save you. I recommend you research for yourself, "New World Order", research what the bible has to say about it, and also the way the real Jesus will come back, so you are not confused when the fake one appears.

Clean Sheet usually refers to that starting of a project or activity from scratch with nothing currently in existence.\n\nSystematic Design usually refers to the rework of something that currently exists into something else using any number of tools or methods to study, design, deploy and implement the changes.\n\n\n\nSo, using these definitions to answer your question, some of the items to consider are:\n\n* Clean Sheet Pros\n - Get to fix what is wrong! USA culture tends to like the Lone Ranger mentality – or is a throw away society.\n - Create something new.\n - Looks new and clean (at least initially)\n - Excitement of something new.\n\n* Clean Sheet Cons\n - Need to look at any legal requirements that may not have impacted an existing organization.\n - May not learn from the past or from mistakes that have been previously made.\n - May not have expertise in all areas that will be needed. Easy to miss something important.\n\n* Systematic Design Pros\n - Build on what has been learned before.\n - Usually appears cheaper on the surface, however, tens to fail to live up the promise once the changes start to occur.\n - Get to fix what is wrong! USA culture tends to like the Lone Ranger mentality – or is a throw away society.\n- Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n\n* Systematic Design Cons\n - If anything is wrong with the current structure or organization, then legal consequences may result for the management team (i.e. if there is any hazardous waste found on the property, top managers can go to jail).\n - Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n - Changing the metal attitudes or culture of the organization can be very hard and time consuming.\n - Is it that people do not like change, or that people do not like forced change!\n\n\nOne of many examples that you could look at this why a management team of a manufacturing organization chooses to either build a new plant in an area where there has never been a manufacturing site before (Clean Sheet – sometimes called Green Site) versus the remodeling of an existing plant to make some product.\n\nYou can search on various web sites to see how some companies have approach this concept. While some will rebuild existing structures, others may want to set up a entirely new facility in a new area that has not had manufacturing before.\n\n\nOther areas that you can look for information on this question include: Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Toyota Production System (TPD), Ford Production System (FPD), Kaizen, changing culture or behavior topics or instruction system design within the training community. \n\nGood Luck

Well, you aren't very specific..are you still awaiting trial? If so, there is no time limit per se. However, once you are sentenced, there is a limit as to how long a county jail will keep you. In CA, if you are sentenced to over 1 year for a felony, then you go to prison. If it's less than 1 year, then you stay in county. I believe each state has a time limit they can hold you after arrest without filing charges. So that may be the 30 days they are talking about. \nPlease don't listen to everything prisoners say. A few really do know the system, but most of them know just a little bit.\n\nAfterthought?...You have internet access in jail? Sounds more like Camp Snoopy

PCO is when the eggs in your monthly cycle fails to release and developes into a bubble(simply put). The more eggs that fail to release forms into more and more bubbles that form a cluster and that is where the term poly(means many) began to form on the ovary. Each month a woman has an egg released and when it does not fully mature and travel the normal process it stops and stays on the ovary, again forming a cluster. So having PCO means many cyst on your ovary and it woul stand out on an ultrasound, looking exactly like a cluster of grapes but only a doctor can read the ultrasound. As far as i know the only treatment for it is removal of the whole ovary. If you had it the doctor would have told you the time you had the US. So it may be nothing to worry about. I know I had to have my right one remove DEC last year. You only need one ovary to have a child as long as that one ifs functioning properly and releasing an egg or two :). Good Luck baby girl

The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a reading passage is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Although they supposedly use the same measures, just placed into a different scale, the results of the two tests do not always correlate (a text with a better score on the Reading Ease test over another text may end up with a worse score on the Grade Level test.)\n\nFlesch-Kincaid Grade Level\nAn obvious use for readability tests is in the field of education. The "Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula" translates the 0-100 score to a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. \n\nThe result is a number that corresponds with a grade level. For example, a score of 6.1 would indicate that the text is understandable by an average student in 6th grade.

It certainly is good that the Minuteman Project is ready, willing and able to do at least part of the Job that the President continues to refuse to do. The only time these folks have to worry about anyone getting hurt is when THEY, in the name of "free speech" are the ones doing the violence! \n\nI haven't heard one instance where the Minutemen were violent towards illegals or their opposition. I HAVE seen where those who oppose the Minutemen were violent towards the Minutemen. Wish I had that link where those ILLEGAL immigrants and their supporters stormed a stage at a university where a Minuteman was speaking. It was despicable but not surprising since violence and shouting down people seems to be the only way these lawless losers can debate anyone!
Yea your out of your dam mind
It depends on the diet. If you are looking for low-cal: NO because even non fat milk has calories, so does the caramel sauce, and so does the vanilla syrup in the beverage. You're beverage, as is, will be approximately 280 calories. That's not terrible, but it isn't helpful to maintain weight loss, especially since it's not a balanced diet, which is by far most important, and a characteristic other places have.\nIf you want to make the drink lower in calories, reduce the amount of caramel sauce on top (just say "light caramel") and change the vanilla to sugar free (made with splenda). This will greatly reduce you calories, by as much as 75 per drink!\nIf you care about fat, the only fat is coming from the caramel, so reducing that will help.\nIf you care about Atkins/carbs, heavy cream has 0 carbs, half-and-half has approx 1/serving, so about 3-4/drink. Not bad.\nIf you care about the negative effects of dairy on the body (humans aren't made to consume bovine dairy, we all become intolerant eventually), the soy milk is a great solution, and it helps the body in many ways (creating a better balance that WOULD be beneficial for your diet along with other measures.\nOrganic whole milk is also available, if all you care about is the hormones in the milk, which are significant, and abolishing them is helpful to the body.\n\nHope this helps.

WELL...AFTER TAKING THE MCAT I FEEL FOR YOU. MY BEST ADVICE WOULD BE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME PRACTICE TESTS AND TAKE AS MANY AS YOU CAN BEFORE YOUR ACTUAL TEST DATE. STAGE EACH PRACTICE TEST EXACTLY AS THE ACTUAL TEST WILL BE ADMINISTERED. I TOOK 8 FULL LENGTH MCAT'S PRIOR TO MY TEST DATE AND EACH TIME MY SCORE ROSE. ON TEST DAY IT WAS NO BIG DEAL BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT AND I SCORED HIGHEST ON THAT TEST. ALSO INBETWEEN TESTS STUDY CONTENT, MAKE FLASH CARDS. EAT SLEEP AND BREATHE SCIENCE. THEN DRINK

She couldnt have taken 10 minutes to start breathing, she would not survive.\nThe following quote is from the link below about premature babies but it is still relevant.\nTake your baby to a doctor and have her checked out.\n\nBabies normally breathe 20 to 60 times a minute. It is normal for babies to stop breathing for up to 10 to 12 seconds. These breathing pauses are considered to be normal if the baby begins breathing again by himself and there is no change in the baby's skin color and no drop in heart rate. Babies may also have a breathing pattern in which they have a breathing pause and then breathe several rapid shallow breaths. This is called periodic breathing and is also considered to be normal. Pauses between breaths that are longer than 15 seconds or pauses that occur with a change in the baby's skin color and a drop in heart rate are not normal.

First, to correct one of the last posters, Ad-Aware's website is http://www.lavasoftusa.com. It's most likely a spyware issue, or maybe even a virus issue but that's less likely.\n\nThe reason this happens is because sites that have http:// in the front of them are using port 80 to communicate. When the site has https:// that means port 443 is being used, and that connection is secure. So there is something that is blocking, interrupting, or taking over the communication flow for HTTP traffic.\n\nGood luck

Sheer volume. When a river flows into the sea, it takes time for the waters to mix. While they are mixing, their salt content will vary. Also, various currents exist within the oceans, separated by temperature, which also affect salinity. The whole system is controlled by gravity, wind, and solar energy. Very complex, but also quite interesting. You might want to pick up an oceanography text if the subject interests you.

Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a "universal receiver". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a "universal donor". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.

No, it just doesn't work in some cultures. Look at the former USSR... the Communist Party is coming back stronger than ever and it's because Democracy in Russia has put so many people into the streets and the Russian mobsters have taken over just about everything over there including many top positions in Government. Many Russians have been protesting to have the Communist's put back into power. For the last year or so, Russians have had to do something they have not had to do before...They now have to pay their own utility bills. Now they have to pay for water, gas and electricity. \n\nI feel that Socialism and Democracy can work well together if implemented correctly. You can have a Socialist Government and still have Freedom. \n\nThat form of Government should be put into practice here in the USA. I don't know about you but I am tired of having 5% of the people here in the USA controling 95% of the wealth!\n\nPower should never be allowed to be in the hands of one person!\n\nMany Americans don't see it yet but in the last decade, we have been losing some of our freedoms! (Think about it).\n\nWomen should be treated as equals all over the world. I believe that day will come.\n\nBy the way, the Iran/Iraq War lasted from 1980 - 1988.

Well if your story has any truth to it, obviously, it wouldn't be that hard to figure you out! You're the intern at the record label.\n\nAnyway, don't tell, just yet! Let the story escalate within the industry, let the price go up, and then sell!!! It's all about taking care of number one, and if someone is willing to pay you for it- go for it! Don't feel bad about kissing and telling, feel sorry for the fools who pay you to tell it, and more so, buy it, read it, and believe it!!\n\nAnd just think about the scandal, and the lawsuit, if you should loose your job over it! Why should you loose your position, (because your a woman, I presume), is the label dropping him because he willingly engaged in such situation, as well? By the time you're done with him and the record label, you won't need to worry about a career!
At a certain altitude (25,200 miles) it takes exactly 24 hours to orbit the Earth. Since the Earth turns in 24 hours, the satellite appears to stay over the exact same longitude.\n\nIt is important also to have the orbit lie along the equator. If the orbit is at an angle to the equator, the satellite will appear to move north and south throughout the day. \n\nOnce a satellite is in this geosynchronous (moves at the same speed as the Earth) or geostationary (hovers over the same point on the surface of the Earth) orbit, we can aim a satellite dish at it and not have to move the dish.\n\nThis works when you have a good line of sight to the geostationary orbit. Countries that are far to the north and south don't have a good line of sight. In the 60's, the USSR used to launch communications satellites in polar orbit. Their satellite dishes had to swing slowly south to track the satellite, then swing quickly north to meet the next one when it came over the horizon. If you needed a system like that in the US, satellite television would be too complicated and too expensive for the average homeowner.

What you are describing is a man who wants to control the people in his life. He says whatever he needs to get what he wants. Abusers (batterers) are very jealous, are very effective at driving away family and friends, like to keep their women "barefoot and pregnant" (4 kids 10 and under). Often they don't really want children, but they know children will tie their women to them, keeping her dependent on him. It's hard for you to become independend if you have 4 young children "hanging onto your skirts." I'll bet he has you living a hand-to-mouth existence. (dictionary.com describes as: Having or providing only the bare essentials.)\n\nCheck out this list of questions on The National Domestic Violence Hotline site: http://www.ndvh.org/educate/abuse_quiz.html. Make sure he's not home when you do this, to protect yourself. It's probably a good idea to make sure the kids aren't around either. You need to be safe when you check it out. And delete it from your history so he can't find it either. Their phone number is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). If someone should come in when you're on their site there's a red ESCAPE button in the upper right corner that will take you to Google. It'll look like you're doing something other than seeking help in an abusive relationship. These people are trained to help women and children in your situation. They can help you find a program close to you who can help you navigate through the system.\n\nI pray you and your children will be safe, healthy and happy. God Bless!

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (Arabic: أبومصعب الزرقاوي‎) (c. October 1966 – June 7, 2006) was a Salafi Muslim terrorist leader and the self-proclaimed leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. One or more individuals identifying themselves as Zarqawi took responsibility, on several audiotapes, for numerous acts of terrorism in Iraq, including the killing of many civilians and the taking of hostages. He was also allegedly responsible for many other acts of violence, including the beheading of hostages (possibly including Nick Berg) in Iraq.\n\nAs an Islamist identified with the Salafi movement of Wahhabism, Zarqawi opposed the presence of American and Western military forces in the Islamic world and opposed the West's support for Israel. In September 2005, he reportedly declared "all-out war" on Shia Muslims in Iraq,[1] and is believed responsible for dispatching numerous Al-Qaeda suicide bombers throughout Iraq, and especially to areas with large concentrations of Shia civilians. As the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq he is suspected of causing thousands of people's deaths--many if not most of them civilians.\n\nZarqawi, a longtime ally of Osama bin Laden, was a high-ranking member of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, and since October 2004 had referred to his own organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Holy War Group, an insurgent network operating in Iraq, as "Al-Qaeda in Iraq". On October 21, 2004, Zarqawi officially announced his allegiance to Al Qaeda; on December 27, 2004, Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of bin Laden calling Zarqawi "the prince of al Qaeda in Iraq" and asked "all our organization brethren to listen to him and obey him in his good deeds."[2]\n\nZarqawi was the most wanted man in Jordan and Iraq,[3] having participated in or masterminded a number of violent actions against United States, Jordanian and Iraqi targets. The U.S. government offered a USD $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount offered for the capture of bin Laden before March 2004. On October 15, 2004, the U.S. State Department added Zarqawi and the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad group to its "list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations" and ordered a freeze on any assets that the group might have in the United States. On February 24, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice's FBI also added al-Zarqawi to the "Seeking Information – War on Terrorism" list, the first time that he had ever been added to any of the FBI's three major "wanted" lists.[4]\n\nZarqawi was killed in Baquba by a United States airstrike on June 7, 2006
See what bacteria are on your hands after you wash them with different kinds of soap versus just rinsing them with water. The trick is getting the starting point to be the same. I think what you'd need to do is wipe your hands down with alcohol and have a source of bacteria (a piece of raw chicken could work) that you rub your hands on each time. I would imagine something like: rinse your hands with ethanol (to kill whatever is already there), touch the bacteria source, wipe your fingers on a control plate (if you don't have proper aguar plates, you can use chicken broth as per the experiment above), wash your hands with the soap to be tested, and wipe your hands on another plate. Rinse your hands with enthanol again and repeat for other soaps and plain water. Leave the samples to grow overnight (or longer) and compare the bacteria growth on the different plates.\n\n___________________\nI just thought of another experiment that could be really cool... Leave your plates (or chicken broth, or whatever) out in the air for a while, so they get both mold and bacteria growing on them. Let them grow for a while, and observe the locations of bacteria in relation to mold. That's how Alexander Flemming discovered penicillin!
Alright, this sounds like simple miscommunication. First, there is no MOS "Mike 6" - that is an ASI designator to the 91W MOS (which is converting to the 68W MOS). The concept here is that you enlist with the 68W MOS (which is the Army's equivalent to First Responder - in fact the AIT is recognized by the DOT for such purposes), then after some service time BUT BEFORE YOU REACH E-5 (P) RANK (that's Sergeant promotable), you go to the M6 school (M6 is an "Additional School Identifier or ASI) which trains and then licenses you as a licensed practicing nurse (LPN). There is no way to get the M6 ASI without first attending AIT and being qualified as a 68W, then reporting to your unit. If it is not in your enlistment contract, then the M6 school is NOT guaranteed. Instead you will have to apply through your chain of command for it. If it is in your contract than you are set. It doesn't sound like he/she is lying to you but it certainly sounds like there is some miscommunication going on. For further info - I have linked the 91W/68W MOS web site and the M6 ASI websites below. If you are really concerned, do just like you would with a doctor - get a second opinion from a different recruiter in a different city. Sounds like everything is good to go - just confirm that your M6 ASI School is guaranteed in your enlistment contract.
For what state? I am a recruiter in MD, Metropolitan area.
No absolutely not. It's my favourite.\n\nDöner Kebab (as döner kebap in Turkish and often simply kebap, döner, doner or donner.), which literally means "turning roast" is the name given to a Turkish dish made with lamb (or mutton), beef or chicken. A version developed to suit German tastes by Turkish immigrants in Berlin has become one of the world's most popular fast food dishes. It is essentially the same dish as shawarma and gyros, possibly differing from them in the type of meat and spices used.
Well basically in osmosis, there are 3 solutions: hypertonic,hypotonic and isotonic. Drinking saltwater causes a hypertonic solution in your cells. The most basic way to explain this is as you drink saltwater, the salt solutions gather outside your cells. No water comes in and the remaining water gets pushed out causing crenation, shriveling of the cell. You can see it externally when your hands wrinkle when wet for too long right? Imagine it acting through your internal organs so I think its kinda like dehydration from within, which is exactly what people try to avoid when they drink saltwater out of desperation right? hehe.

Ask your physician about a statin to help lower the LDL and total cholesterol. Ask about Tricor, Zetia, and/or Niaspan or Niacin to help lower your Triglycerides. To lower your LDL and total cholesterols, stay away from cheese, red meat, and any type of animal fatty foods. To lower your triglycerides, limit your sweets, alcohol, carbohydrates (which quickly turn into sugar in the body), this includes natural sugars (as in fruits) also...it is still sugar. No more than about 3 servings of fruits a day, including juices. If you like carbohydrates, choose high fiber carbs. And you should think about diet and exercise EVERY day, don't wait until it is too late.
Why do you want to stop eating? If it is to lose weight it won't work. You have to eat to lose weight. Sounds wierd but it's true.
well that does kind of present a problem... but if you believe in God than you would already be following Jesus... therefore, problem solved... you would have to believe in both and not just one or the other. So yes- all things are possible - if you believe and follow the teachings...
Limits to infinity can give you the upper or lower bound of a function. In other words they can give you a horizontal asymptote for the graph of a function. It will tell you that a quantity will get no higher (or lower) than this value.\n\nAlso, limits to infinity are used to compute infinite integrals. An amazing example is the area between the graph of y = e^(-x) from x=0 to infinity and the x-axis. You might think that the area is infinite since the x values go from 0 to infinity, but actually the answer is 1 sq. unit.

Jacksonville is not like the typical south. I have been there a couple times. It's a big city for Florida. It is also a Navy town so all kinds of people live there. Most of Florida is not southern, some places still are, but it's the smaller cities, mostly close to Georgia. You'll be fine. I live in a smaller community and we have interracial families.\nDon't expect southern kindness down here, because most of the people here are from up north, so they bring all kinds of personalities with them. You never know what your going to get. Most of the racist remarks I hear are from the Yankees, go figure.

Ireland, the IRA was/is the militant branch of Sinn Fein, a Politically recognised party of Ireland, in fact when Sinn Fein set up the Assembly of Ireland there were attempts to officially recognise the IRA as the army of Ireland. Despite being part of a relatively credible political party, the IRA performed many acts of political terrorism, including the infamous Brighton bombings.\n\nNote that this is also labelled as 'Geurilla Warfare' by some commentators, to be fair the idea of Political Terrorism depends on your point of view i suppose

Numa Numa (or "the Numa Numa Dance") is an Internet phenomenon based on amateur videos, particularly one by Gary Brolsma, made for the song "Dragostea din tei" by Romanian pop band O-Zone.\n\nThe phrase "Numa Numa" comes from the chorus of the song, "nu mă, nu mă iei," meaning, roughly, "(you) won't take, won't take me."\n\n\nNu mă, nu mă iei ("You don't, you don't take me") becomes "noma, noma yay!" ("drink, drink, yay!")

You really should have started trying a few days ago. The best time would be about 2 days before ovulation to give the sperm time to reach the egg. Sperm are not very fast and could use the extra time especially since the egg has limited viability (24-48 hours). If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.

Well I don't know if it was a ghost or a spirit or maybe just an energy, but I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago. I was living at my parent's house at the time and they were away for the weekend so I was home alone. I had a friend come over to my house and we were just hanging out, drinking some wine and chatting. We finished the bottle of wine and I placed the empty bottle on the kitchen table next to a candle I was planning to put in it. We decided to go out to meet some people and came back about 2 hours later. When I opened the front door I saw the candle was placed in the neck of the bottle AND IT WAS LIT with only one drip of wax running down the side. I had an alarm set with motion detectors when I left the house. These candles burned very quickly, so it must have been lit just moments before I got home. I'm so glad I had a friend with me to vouch for it because no one believes it when they ehar it. Funny thing is, it was almost comforting to me because I think it was my grandmother telling me she was there to watch over me. I felt very peaceful for a while after that happened. I've been waiting for something like it to happen ever since, I have a fascination with it.
(in literary/creative arts) It is the part in your paper where you write expressions of gratitude. You thank people/organization that helped/assisted you in writing/creating a literary or artistic work (be it in the form of encouragement/moral or spiritual support, technical support, critism/editorial support, idea/conceptual support, funding/financial support, etc.).\n\n(in law/legal matters) It is a declaration or avowal of one's own act, to give it legal validity; as, the acknowledgment of a deed before a proper officer. The term also refers to the certificate of the officer attesting such declaration.

Have you ever heard of a game called Rochambeaux (pronounced row-sham-bow)? It's where two guys take turns kicking each other in the nuts until one of them gives up. It's a really good thing in that game if you get to go first ... to my knowledge, there has never been a second kick in a single game of Rochambeaux!
It can, but it is very unlikely to.\n\nIn the wild animals have mechanisms that avoid prolonged inbreeding. Added to that humans are geneticlaly all very similar. Most other animals species are far more genetically diverse, which reduces the risks associated with inbreeding.

Panda Titanium 2006 is easy to install, setup and there are fewer options to confuse the user. The software has a clean consistent appearance throughout the different screens that looks great and makes sense. \n\n\nPanda holds ICSA Labs Product Certification in both virus detection and virus cleaning. However, the program hasn't done so well with the VB 100% tests. Panda has failed three times and the only time it passed was in April 2001. The software hasn't been screened since 2002. The program did receive level 1 Checkmark from West Coast Labs but not the level 2. \n\nPanda Titanium has fewer options than many Antivirus programs. More advanced users may want to opt for the Panda Platinum package; it gives more configuration options and a firewall. Both products use the same scan engine providing the same level of virus security. The program also scans for anti-spyware to help better protect your machine and identity. \n\nSystem performance does not suffer too much and the scanning time is similar to other antivirus software. \n\nTitanium has an automatic update function. A full service scheduler would allow the user to define how often and when scans would occur. \n\nAn online database features answers to frequently asked questions. This is a good place to start if you have a question about the product. \n\n\nA complete list of features and side-by-side comparisons are available on the Anti-Virus Software Review HomePage.

The warmer the air the more moisture it can hold, so there is an increase in the humidity. When you chill air, the moisture is released, making rain. When it gets warm the water evaporates as it is held by the air.
It generally depends on the state you are in. Most states are now"no fault" states-meaning no one is to blame-and the insurance companies generally work out the details and pay accordinly.The laws of the state in which the accident occurs determine who pays for the damages from an automobile accident. Basically, in a "no-fault" insurance state, fault is not placed on either party, and each driver generally submits a claim to his or her own insurance company instead of establishing blame. Many states, including Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and others, have some form of no-fault insurance laws.

Même si il n'y a plus aucun interet pour le titre de champion......la relégation mérite encore qu'on s'y intéresse.

is there any difference created in the team selection or approach of BCCI towards game through our tips ? Then why should we think about it ? No doubt winning world cup is a matter of pride and honour for us and our country. But when the people sitting at top have no respect of our expectations, then what we can do. They are just happy with the politics. So there is no point in disussing this. And as far as world cup is concerned then forget @ India. It will be great if they could go ahead from even league matches. So now just stop supporting the team. This is my request to all of u. \nJust wasting 9 precious hours in watching India's match is foolishness now. Its @ wasting almost 600 hours (that is, more than 25 days) per year, if india plays 45-50 days cricket in an year !!!! Its difficult to stop ourselves but we need to do this, becoz there are many more important things in our life... Forget Chappel, Forget Dravid, Forget Ganguly.... and Forget Indian team... if u just remembers cricket any day then just watch highlight of Sachin's inning against Aussie at Sarjah of 1998. Entire cricket is in that inning.... Cricket is not more than that...\nSorry for being so emotional... but i m too much disturbed due to team's performance, strategies, and the main point, selection.
Research has proven that suppliments probably do little if any good. If you want instant weight gain, use Creatine...will add about 5 pounds of water to the average person, wets the muscles and helps them heal. Other than that, IF you get a good diet, suppliments are pretty much a waste of your money. Regardless of all the hype you see, old fashioned hard work and a good balanced diet is the only way it is going to happen. You do NOT want to put on fat, so stick with a good diet of meat, carbs, oils, in all, a balanced diet. There will be plenty who tell you >>>protein shakes, protein bars, etc...waste of money, period. But if it makes you feel like you are doing something, then do what ever you want. Good luck

You're friend can not take the fifth unless she somehow incriminates herself by testifying. For example, there are two business CEO. CEO 1 is on trial. CEO 2 would take the fifth testifying in CEO 1's trial if he's testimony would incriminate himself.\n\nSince she is the victim of on assult I would say taking the fifth is not a logical choice.\n\nIt depends on the case as far as if she has to testify or not. The judge can make her come to court and testify by issuing a subpoena (which should be delivered by mail and/or a cop knocking on the door). If she chooses NOT to go to court even though a subpoena was issued she can be in BIG trouble and action can be taken against her. \n\nIf she doesn't want to testify she should go to the court house (as soon as possible) and get information from the District Attorney, Clerk of Court and/or the prosecuting attorney in determining whether she has to testify or not.

because there is very little resistance in space. objects in motion will stay in motion unless a force acts on them. since they are in space, there's not really much of a foce acting on them with one exception: gravity.\n\ngravity of course pulls the satellites down towards the earth. but the satellite is moving at a fairly constant velocity in a direction which is tangent to the earth. so the direction of travel is always perpendicular to the force of gravity, which means that the satellite stays in perfect orbit.\n\nif it used its fuel to speed up, it would overcome the earth's gravity and fly off into space. if it used its fuel to slow down, the earth's gravity would overcome the satellites speed and pull it in. orbit is the perfect middle ground between these two.\n\nnow if there were a bunch of air in space, then the air molecules would cause friction that would slow the satellite down. the earth's gravity would then pull it in and cause it to crash. so to overcome the air molecules, the satellite would need a constant thrust to keep it in orbit. but since there is little or no resistance in space, it doesn't need to hit its boosters at all. it just needs to get up to the perfect speed and physics will take care of the rest.\n\nsorry if this was unclear. it's late ;p

Diabetes is a disease in which the body is unable to produce or unable to properly use and store glucose (a form of sugar). Glucose backs up in the bloodstream — causing one’s blood glucose (sometimes referred to as blood sugar) to rise too high. \n\nThere are two major types of diabetes. In type 1 (fomerly called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent) diabetes, the body completely stops producing any insulin, a hormone that enables the body to use glucose found in foods for energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take daily insulin injections to survive. This form of diabetes usually develops in children or young adults, but can occur at any age. Type 2 (formerly called adult-onset or non insulin-dependent) diabetes results when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin and/or is unable to use insulin properly (insulin resistance). This form of diabetes usually occurs in people who are over 40, overweight, and have a family history of diabetes, although today it is increasingly occurring in younger people, particularly adolescents.
I am good and bad like everyone else. There is no black and white among us humans.
Jewish people aren't, categorically, different from anyone else - when offended, we act just like anyone does, getting mad for a while and (hopefully) coming to forgive that person in the end.\n\nOur religion teaches us to forgive - on Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement, we explicitly seek for forgive everyone who has wronged us, and pray that they will forgive us. The rabbis teach that praying to God for forgiveness on Yom Kippur seeks forgiveness for sins against God - failure to keep the sabbath, taking His name in vain - but forgiveness for sins against another person only comes when that other person has forgiven. So, we seek to forgive those that have hurt us, so that they may be completely forgiven for their wrongs.\n\nThere's a parallel to most other religions I can think of - while the greatest teachers of peace have learned to forgive their enemies even in the moment that they are being harmed, those of us who can't are still taught to forgive as much as possible, and called on to remember where we nurse grudges and let them heal.\n\nHope this helps.
I believe the equation for solving this is:\nS=P(1+i)^n where S is the amount after n periods, P is the initial Principal and i is the interest rate. Therefore S=18,250,000(1+.05)^(158)\nassuming annual compounding. The answer is (drum-roll) $40,660,440,000.

You can not convert a file system on a disk without reformatting it, which ever operating system you use. If you're running windows XP Home edition on a FAT 32 file system and want to change the file system to NTFS, you'll have to reformat your PC using a Windows XP CD, which will give you the option of formatting the disk with a specific file system. Personally, I don't advice running windows XP on a FAT 32 file system.

Ovaries are in great demand these days!\n\nGet an ultasound done to check if ovaries exist at the place.\n\nHave you tried premarin? Though controversial it may help! Else a safe way is to use Shatawari Ghrut, an ayurvedic paste, if available close by.\n\nYour hysterectomy suggests you had hormone imbalance (Estrogen dominance causing heavy frequent cycles or similar problem, so ovaries missing is a close possibility). If that is case, local application of Shatawari Ghrutam for 3 months is a good remedy.

Try chatting online to people and start going to pubs and clubs more often to build your own confidence. \n\nYou'll meet someone when you least expect it.

Anything that is fried contains LOADS of unhealthy fat. \n\nRed meats contain fat - and they are terribly 'banished' by the view of the 'healthful world' but in my eyes, our grandparents did quite well on it.. it's HOW we fix it now and such... Red meats contain iron and many other nutrients that we do need.\n\nHere is a link from the Food and Drug Admin on Fats - some are good and some are bad.. hopefully this will help you start to forumulate your own belief system in that area.

Bad Day by Daniel Powter. I discovered this song nearly a year ago and have been infatuated with it ever since. I actually was one of the first people to hear of him in America because he was HUGE in France and I decided to have a listen. It really is a great song and I highly recommend the album. It's titled Daniel Powter and was released in 2005.

Unlike the the depraved rantings of previous posters, I'm going to try to give you a real answer.\n\nSocialists, like in France, Sweden, and a lot of other European countries, believe that the government should provide a certain level of basic services for all citizens. This includes universal health care, social security retirement savings, and a host of other programs. They tax heavily to pay or all this. In some nations, the tax rate is 50% or higher.\n\nIn the United States, Liberals believe that the government has a mandate to help the most unfortunate in our society. While they don't all believe in universal health care, they don't understand why the richest nation on Earth cannot provide medical services to any citizen who does not have insurance. They believe that the government should step in and help people who are unemployed or underemployed. US liberals are NOT socialists, but they are closer to socialism than the conservaives are. Conservatives believe that every citizen should look out for themselves, with no support from the government; that America is the land of opportunity, and if you don't take advantage of those opportunities, that's your problem, not the problem of society in general.

You have courage. Yes on the get drunk and continue idea. But you have already come quite a distance. Be sure you use antiseptic mouthwash to keep the field as clean as you can... are(is) the remnant(s) loose enough so you could get in there with a pair of tweezers? I hesitate to criticize anyone so determined to get the job done. That area has been irritated a bit, so your body is already at work to reject the rest of the tooth fragments. You didn't say which part of your mouth it is in, but it would appear you are making progress, here. I also like the idea of quit for today and try again tomorrow to remove few more pieces. You are a bit outside the normal dental protocols. But after all, this is your tooth. You have a right, if you know what I mean. I certainly wish you luck. I have successfully removed a tooth or two, so I know it can be done. Hold positive thoughts and when it quiets down, gently proceed in a professional manner to get the remaining bits. A Q-Tip will help absorb some of the excess wetness right at the site. Make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy to stuff in there to absorb blood or saliva if needs be. Good luck to you, and I hope you have a good report fairly soon. Sent to you with "Get 'er done" energies from Chris in South Portland, Maine, U.S.A.

It shouldn't be the government that does this. I am an Economics major, and spent a semester studying Environmental Economics. The solution can, will, and should come from the private sector. There are many companies out there researching alternate sources of energy, and when it becomes more economical to use these new advances in technology, the market will use them. Right now it is too cost prohibitive to use alternate forms of energy, but as other resources become more scarce, the price of them will go up, and we as a society will use alternate forms of energy, all without having to get the government involved.
I took Accutane, a prescribed medication for serious acne. It has a high success rate, however, doctors are wary of prescribing it because it does have some side effects. Also, you have to take a monthly blood test so they can see if you are pregnant. Otherwise, if you are you must stop the meds immediately because it causes severe birth defects. All in all, a wonderful medication that changed my life. However, I guess there are some downfalls where ever you look.
Basophils are a group of white blood cells which are normally in charge of producing immunoglobulins related to allergic reactions. Their numbers are the least among all white cells (about 100 to 200 per cubic mm of blood). SOmetimes blood tests aren't sensitive enough to detect circulating levels of basophils (they may be residing in certain other tissues in your body), and thus the absolute basophil count may turn out as zero. So don't be too worried about it; if the other indices in your blood work are normal, there shouldn't be a problem.

yup, they did. thats just science. its been proven scientifically. however, the bible teaches us that man is flawed, right? well, the bible was written by men, a few hundred years after jesus died. so, isnt it safe to say that if man is flawed, so is the book he's writing? just because a book says that god made men before animals, and its been proven wrong, that doesnt mean that we werent still created by a greater power, or for a specific purpose. i think ppl are too worried about the book having every word be literally true, and not concerned enough with going through the day trying to be a good person.

You shared a relationship with that person that is like no other. You know each other in a different way than anyone else ever will. Former lovers and future lovers will not even experience the same relationship because, I assume, most of us evolve with each intimate relationship. Plus, you have the added awkwardness of other people around you knowing you 2 as a couple so it is mildly wierd for them as well.

I hate the term cracker. It makes no sense whatsoever and really displays the stupidity of the person using it. This and the even worse term, "honky" are specific slurs that were, at one time, used against immigrants from certain countries but they were never in widespread use.\n\nFurther, there are no negative stereotypes to associate with the words, making them ridiculous. The N word has a great many negative things associated with it. It is an unfortunate fact that many of those stereotypes are embraced by many black people. That's what gives the word its potency. If someone calls you that and you know that many other black people have the qualities the word implies, the word has potency as an insult.\n\nBut for cracker and related terms, there are no negative associations. The average white person is like, I'm not even sure what that means. You might as well make up a word for all the meaning it has. At least when the nation calls us white devils, we know what the hell they mean by that, even if it is ridiculous by nature of being obviously untrue.

Depends on what actually happened to give us more or less chromosomes. In humans, the most likely reason someone would have more or less chromosomes would be nondisjunction (an uneven split of chromosomes) in gametogenesis (process of making sperm or eggs).\n\nMost often, nondisjunction does not produce viable offspring. They die within the first few weeks of gestation. Some nondisjuncted offspring do come to term, but have some pathological problem. Some common diseases that arise from nondisjunction are:\n\nDown's syndrome \nEdward's syndrome \nKlinefelter's syndrome\nPallister-Killian syndrome \nPatau syndrome \nTurner syndrome \nXYY syndrome \nXXX syndrome

(27)\n\n\never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.\nNever shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\nNever shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.

hi!!! i think the reason why you keep waking up is because there is something on you mind. when you fall asleep you brain shuts off and if there is something in you brain that you are "obsessing" over or thinking about allot then your brain can't fall asleep or can't stay asleep, in your case. i had this proble a long time ago. i solved this problem by clearing my conscious. this helped allot!

If there is a judgement as we think, I believe our entire lives will be considered - not just the state we are in before we die. Alot of people who regularly did awful things to others, never did a thing to correct the problems they caused, but thought asking God for forgiveness one time was sufficient - probably went to hell. I.e., you can fool people, but try fooling God.

Post-vacation syndrome (PVS) is a real syndrome that involves emotional and psychological effects. While going off on vacation is fun and relaxing, dealing with the feelings of letdown after your vacation is stressful and depressing for most people. The following tips will help you overcome that letdown feeling before you go away.\n\n1. Prepare to return to a clean house.\n\n\nComing back to a clean and orderly house will keep your good feelings up. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do the work yourself, however. You can hire a maid to clean and organize your home 1-2 days before you leave or return.\n\n2. Set aside 15 minutes a day to read your e-mail.\n\n\nContrary to popular opinion, not responding to your e-mail is stressful during a vacation. Most of us dread the deluge of e-mails that we must face when we get back, particularly if you run a business or enterprise. The dread of having all that e-mail to respond to when you get back is overwhelming; taking a few minutes a day to do this will lessen the pressure and stress of having to do it all when you return. The key here is to take NO MORE than 15 minutes a day.\n\n3. Plan fun time into your first week back.\n\n\nWhether it's going to the movies, reading a book, or taking a hike, having an activity that you can look forward to will help ease the transition back into your everyday routine.\n\n4. Develop your photographs as soon as you get home.\n\n\nDeveloping your photos immediately will keep you in the spirit of the pleasurable vacation time longer.\n\n5. Plan your next vacation on your return trip home.\n\n\nAgain, this gives you something to look forward to and prolongs the relaxing effects of the wonderful time you just had.\n\n6. Plan to work only 1-2 extra hours/day upon your return.\n\n\nMost of us quickly undo the beneficial effects and feelings of our vacations by immersing ourselves in 12-15 hour days when we get back in order to catch up. Planning just an extra 1-2 hours keeps you on top of the workload without rapidly becoming exhausted.\n\n7. Adjust your client schedule.\n\n\nIf you're in a service industry (such as coaching), adjust your client schedule for that month so that you don't have to play catch-up for sessions missed. For example, if you usually coach clients 4 times/month, plan to coach only 3 times that month. Of course, this will entail adjustments on your fees as well but it is well worth the degree of stress you can eliminate from your routine.\n\n8. Play music reminders.\n\n\nPlaying the music of the place where you've been is a soothing reminder of your pleasant vacation and keeps the memories alive longer.\n\n9. Talk about your vacation.\n\n\nTalking to others about your vacation keeps it in the forefront of your mind longer.\n\n10. Stay in touch with people you've met.\n\n\nAs busy as that first week back to work and routine is, it's a good time to make that phone call to 1-2 people you've promised to stay in touch with. Staying in touch keeps the vacation going over time, and it gives you an opportunity to develop new friendships too.
For a true person of knowledge of those kinds of things to answer that, they would need more information. I don't believe so though.

All they are criminal Traitor and All mexicans lover \nvote this candidate Dick Mountjoy.\nhttp://www.betterimmigration.com/candidates/2006/ca.html\n\nQuietly but systematically, the Bush Administration is advancing the plan to build a huge NAFTA Super Highway, four football-fields-wide, through the heart of the U.S. along Interstate 35, from the Mexican border at Laredo, Tex., to the Canadian border north of Duluth, Minn. \n\n\nOnce complete, the new road will allow containers from the Far East to enter the United States through the Mexican port of Lazaro Cardenas, bypassing the Longshoreman’s Union in the process. The Mexican trucks, without the involvement of the Teamsters Union, will drive on what will be the nation’s most modern highway straight into the heart of America. The Mexican trucks will cross border in FAST lanes, checked only electronically by the new “SENTRI” system. The first customs stop will be a Mexican customs office in Kansas City, their new Smart Port complex, a facility being built for Mexico at a cost of $3 million to the U.S. taxpayers in Kansas City. \n\nAs incredible as this plan may seem to some readers, the first Trans-Texas Corridor segment of the NAFTA Super Highway is ready to begin construction next year. Various U.S. government agencies, dozens of state agencies, and scores of private NGOs (non-governmental organizations) have been working behind the scenes to create the NAFTA Super Highway, despite the lack of comment on the plan by President Bush. The American public is largely asleep to this key piece of the coming “North American Union” that government planners in the new trilateral region of United States, Canada and Mexico are about to drive into reality. \n\nhttp://libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=145907\n\nAll they are must be Insane ,we pay mexico superhightway with US taxpayer so wahta baout security ?Drug, smugler peoples..and Mexican drunk driver get VIP road

She is not very tall at all -she's a petite Canadian born little lady - she may be around 5ft2 or 5ft4 and her name is an American Indian word meaning "I'm on my way" she chose that name when she was aspiring to become a singer and raising her siblings by herself - I think her parents died. And her husband name is Mutt.
Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle.\n\nAs a number it is 3.141592 (an easy way to remember it is that there are 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 and 2 letters in "How I Wish I Could Calculate Pi".
I don't know that I can help you. She isn't on Wikipedia. A Yahoo! and Google search appeared to indicate that she may have written some poetry but there was little available info. A search of Galenet's biographical database came up with nothing.

After Doing M.C.A in India you are fully qualified to study in U.S.Doing PH.D in the U.S. has more weightage since there are variety of courses to choose from in the U.S.and also they train you practically.Also you can earn much with U.S. degree.Whereas in India there are limited courses to choose from and it's considered as valuable only if you study in a good University.If you need any details keep posting.Hope this helps you and I deserve 10 points.

If I knew more I could try to help, but I can tell you there is a trade analyzer at fantasyfootball.com that you can input the pick numbers and see who the trade will likely work out best for. It's an inexact science, and if you have a certain player you want, it can be worth taking a small hit. But that can give you a bit of a guide to it.

Imagine we live inside of a foam cushion. Where there are large masses like the sun or earth, the cushion is squeezed tighter so all the bubbles of foam around us would be smaller and squeeze us towards the mass.

Definetly the toss should have the impact on the result. If you take at a look at the statistics about Sabina Park, Kingston - the team who fielded first has won the match more times. The pitch is hardest as well as pacy. Lot of movements will be their and ball will not easily come to the bat on the very first hour of the match, moreover it will be very difficult to play easy shots.\n\nA player like Sreesanth can get more support from this kind of pitch.
There are essentially two parameters to look at when trying to determine the range of an RF Transmitter:\n\nTransmit Power\n\n Transmit power refers to the amount of RF power that comes out of the antenna port of the radio. Transmit power is usually measured in Watts, milliwatts or dBm. (For conversion between watts and dB see below.)\n\nReceiver sensitivity\n\n Receiver sensitivity refers to the minimum level signal the radio can demodulate. It is convenient to use an example with sound waves; Transmit power is how loud someone is yelling and receive sensitivity would be how soft a voice someone can hear. Transmit power and receive sensitivity together constitute what is know as “link budget”. The link budget is the total amount of signal attenuation you can have between the transmitter and receiver and still have communication occur.
My best advice is not to use them - or avoid them as much as possible. They are unreliable.\nThere are so many jump drives out there compatible with almost every computer and OS. And they hold 100+ more info than a floppy.

The time it takes to get pregnant varies for everyone. However, if you are young and have not achieved pregnancy in a year and a half, see your ob/gyn for an infertility work up. Some doctors will see you after a year but some are fairly rigid about the 18 months...especially if you are under 30 years of age.\n\nIt is not common to have a period when you are pregnant but it has been known to happen.

Hey, we are. We've lost are grip on the english language, our students are failing, and the law of entropy is firmly in place.
You mean 3^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 ... dimensionally this works. For examples, if the units are feet, then you can take a bunch of one foot by one foot ceramic floor tiles, and arrange them in a 5 by 5 square, then take away a 4 by 4 square chunk of that, and rearrange what remains into a 3 by 3 square of tiles. Translated into inches, you get (3*12)^2 = (5*12)^2 - (4*12)^2: if you have a whole lot of one inch by one inch tiles, and you make a big 60 by 60 square out of then and remove a 48 by 48 subsquare, then you can rearraqnge the remaining little tiles into a 36 by 36 square.\n\nNow consider 3^5 = 243 = (122 + 121)*(122 - 121) = 122^ - 121^2, again in feet. When you translate that into inches, it doesn't scale the same way: the left hand side is multiplied by 12^5 but the right hand side is only multiplied by 12^2. What kind of geometrical figure do you want to use given that it does not scale? "Take a bunch of little one by one by one by one by one foot hypercubes, and arrange them in five space ... then when you project along the ... the result looks like ..." ??? "... but subdivide each hypercube into 12^5 little one inch by ... hypercubes and what you just did no longer works". Is that really what you are looking for?

Wear chapstick with an SPF to prevent them because the sun can make them pop up. Also if you feel one coming, take an L-Lysine pill (often, as much as the bottle says to take) this also can be taken to prevent them. and try using a product called "abreva" its kind of expensive ($17) but works great. The trick is to use it asap because it speeds up the healing process. If they become a big problem try seeing a doctor, my sister used to get them all the time, since she saw a doctor, she prescribed her a strong medication and now she never gets them.
The motto "Invictae fidelitatis praemium", The Reward of Invincible Loyalty, can be seen in today's Coat of Arms. \n\nHereford /Scudamore\n\nRescued by the King\nFor five weeks Scudamore held the City in spite of the destruction of an arch of the Wye Bridge, the churches of St Martin and St Owen: even the Chapter House roof was stripped of lead for shot. Finally, King Charles with 3000 horse was reported to be travelling from Worcester. Lord Levin and the Scottish Army retreated and on September 4th, Charles entered the City. Colonel Scudamore was knighted immediately and the city was given a new Coat of Arms. \nThe ten silver saltires or crosses, depict the Scottish Army encircling the City and the buckles on the collars of the supporters are taken from the arms of the Lord Leven. The motto "Invictae fidelitatis praemium", The Reward of Invincible Loyalty, can be seen in today's Coat of Arms.

Aren't both parties cheating in this situation? The wife is not only having sex with someone besides her husband, but it is homosexual sex also. Does that make her in the wrong twice as much or does it not count as cheating at all? Just a thought.\n\nAs for the man, yes, he is cheating, but with permission. It's not a glorified way to cheat, it is approved cheating. What can the wife say if she is also having sex with the third party? \n\nFor the most part, men have this fantasy to boost their ego. The idea that they can satisfy more than one woman at a time and then try to prove it correct is just huge to men. As for who the two girls are, it doesn't matter. As a matter of fact, I think that the man would have even more fun if neither one of the women were his girlfriend or wife. This way he doesn't have to concentrate mostly on one woman.
The Spurs lost because they lost their concentration in overtime during Game 7 of the series. The Dallas Mavericks are a great team. Either team could be facing Pheonix. They both deserve it.

When raising kids, don't forget that parents can be a big influence on them. With the internet nowadays, kids can be exposed to bad things no matter where they are.\n\nI would expose them to world travel. Europe is good place to start. However, they have problems too.Foreign born youths in France don't have many opportunities for advancement.So no matter where you are, be vigilant and active in your kid's life.

I agree, if he's intersted he will call, but honey, its ok for women to break the mold and go for what they want.... If you find him attractive and you want to get to know more about him, Call him but make sure you make it completely slear that your not always going to make the first move and find out why he got your number if he wasnt going to use it? most likely he'll say something like he wasnt sure if you were feeling him and left the ball in your court... be alittle agressive and make that first move adn let him make all the next.
If I were you I'd tell the guy that since his girl doesn't want to watch then maybe it's not such a good idea to proceed with the prior arrangement. You might even have a one on one with her (talking) to see exactly what the problem is, she's either (A)Just not comfortable watching her man performing with someone else even though she's OK with it, or (B)Doesn't like the fact that he's into that sort of thing (swinging). Just do whatever you thing/feel might be better for everyone involved.

nope. in fact, im pretty sure it agined fans. Ad it gained players from different countries. The MLB is so different from the WBC, it couldnt change the way i look at the MLB. Ive been a Knicks, Jets, Mets and Rangers fan since im on this earth. And besides for 94 ( rangers) and 86( mets) it has been a sort of hell-hole to be a fan of those teams. But even thugh they lose, i stay strong. Stay strong for the Americans and soon enough youll get rewarded with good play.

1) go to doubleyourdating.com\n2) buy your boyfriend the e-book "attraction isn't a choice" (~$40, download as .pdf)\n3) tell him to read it, and ask him to apply what he learns to your relationship\n\n(the gist - women usually feel the strongest feelings and passion for strong, manly men who are confident and sure of themselves... and most "nice" guys lose some of that edge. if you both have good self-esteem, then read the book together with him - especially if you want to have one of those relationships where you're still teasing each other ten years from now, and are strong enough to agree to disagree about the stuff that doesn't matter that much, but neither one of you will abuse the other, nor allow yourself to be abused.\n\ni won't go into the evolutionary psychology about why it will work... it just will.\n\nthe book will tell him to tone down the "sweetness" a little, but that doesn't mean he can't still be caring, loving, and affectionate, and do the right thing.\n\ngirls just don't get hot and bothered about guys whose main aura is "sweet". read a romance novel, a man with a little beast in him is a good thing, as long as he's still got honor).\n\nalso, how much he uses what he learns is something he can "dial up" or "dial down" to keep your fire burning at just the right hotness. and ironically, you can use the same ideas to throw it right back at him, and that will keep his fire stoked also.\n\njust be careful not to burn down the house.
Science teachers just teach what they have to. It does not mean that they believe in it. My science teacher was really good about all of this. She said that she is not defending ID or evolution but just presenting the theory. She did insist on us to believe in either.

Redi and Spallanzani had already done some experiments disproving the hypothesis of spontaneous generation. However, many people still believed in this false idea.They argued that air was necessary for spontaneous generation. Spallanzani had kept air out of his experiment. \nWhen Pasteur did his experiment, he did not seal the end of his flask, the end of the flask was open to the air but had a long, curved neck. He showed that microorganisms did not arise in a boiled nutrient broth even if it is exposed to air as long as airborne matter was not allowed to enter the broth. \nLouis Pasteur put an end to to the spontaneous generation hypothesis.He definitely proved that life comes only from life.

Starting with the grip:\nYou probably want to use a 'Semi-Western' or a 'Western' forehand grip. Essentially you want to hold the racquet as you would a frying pan, making sure you grip it at the very bottom of the grip.\n\nThe swing:\nTo start you racket head wants to be back and lower than where you want to make contact with the ball, keep your arm reasonably close to your side.\nContact with the ball is the most imporant part of the swing, the 'contact point' wants to be in front of your body, idealy at around net height, your racket heads wants to be pressing forwards and up.\nTo finnish the shot you want to keep your eyes on where you made contact with the ball, your racket head finnishes up high over your shoulder and your hips and shoulders should be 'squared' to the net.\n\nTo really learn a top spin forehand you want to get on a tennis court with someone that can either teach you, or knows how to hit one and you can watch their technique.\n\nPlayers like Rafael Nadal hit with alot of topspin so I would recommend you watch him play on TV if you have the chance, and Roger Federer is awesome and everyone can try and learn from him.

Newer, larger and faster computers means some companies now record the security cameras right to their computer's hard drive. Or use burnable DVD recorders. If this is the case those records could last years. They could store a year's worth of DVDs in 2 3" binders on a shelf. Who knows how long a store might keep records these days if they really wanted to.

Trust is just an emotion. People without ethics don't care much about your emotions but mostly about their own self-interest and advancement at any cost. Actually most of us are like that in one way or another. When it comes to what's really important in your life, sometimes you will forsake friendship and loyalty. I guess it's not true friendship or loyalty.

A heart attack occurs when muscles in one or more areas of the heart fail to work. The other muscles of the heart kick in to get the blood going where it needs to and a person seeks medical attention. Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops completely and resuscitation measures are taken most times with no good results.

i've researched this on the web many month's ago. basicaly the video from a distance showing him rise (space above/below him) was filmed earlier with some sort of cable device lifting him.\n\nthe close up footage of his feet is an illusion. next time you see it you will notice that the few times he preforms this in front of different people he always positions his body the same way toward the crowd. what he is doind is going on his toes (on one foot) but lifting the other foot completely off the ground. When your body is positioned at the proper angle it looks like he's floating.

The ocean is definitely more interesting. Space is just as the name implies. True, it is mind-boggling to think of such a concept as infinite space, but the ocean is what fascinates me. Humans have been able to venture into space even before we had the ability to explore our own oceans. We still can't chart our oceans, and I think that we should focus on this more before we send out more shuttles to space.

Painkillers can become severely habit forming, especially if you have been taking them for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.) You can try to wean yourself off of the pills slowly, reducing your dosage gradually or increase the time period between doses. This will be a process that takes place over time. You will still have to take the pills, and it could be a while before you get off of them, but you won't crack up from withdrawl!\n\n3.) You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try. Check out your local GNC for some hep if you want to avoid the doctor.

Yahoo is web based e-mail, unless you pay for POP through Yahoo called "Mail Plus", available for $20/month. Just in case you don't know, POP is where the e-mail is downloaded to your compuer, but web-mail is stored on the server on the web. You can usually view POP mail through the web, but it doesnt work the other way around.\n\nSolution: sign up for POP access. This will allow that cool e-mail feature to work. You can do that through your ISP for free, Yahoo and MSN charge a little bit. I use Bluebottle (it's free!) Then set up Mail according to the e-mail server settings.
What is the best stock is a question subject to great uncertainty. In other words, it is sort of like betting on a horse prior to a horse race. Certain companies sell at higher price to earnings ratios than others. These are the 2-1 bets. Other stocks have low price to earnings ratios. These are the 20-1 long shots. The market at any time tends to price each stock in relation to its earnings potential, its dividend, and other factors. If the market were 100% efficient, then all stocks would be equally good. There is a good deal of rational for this reasoning. One rational is that the vast majority of mutual funds-75%--tend to underperform the average stock. Some of their underperformance is due to their expenses. Some is due to the fact that no matter what they buy, it will tend not to perform any bettern than the market in general. \n\nAs a result many mutual funds and exchange traded funds have come to market that try to match the market in general. In other words they have thrown in the towel in trying to pick the best stocks. \n\nBut!!! Mutual funds have to invest a LOT of money billions of dollars. With that much money to invest they have a problem. They just can not find a good stock and dump a billion dollars into it. \n\nSince you do not have a billion to invest (my assumption based on the fact that if you did you would not be asking this question here) you may be able to beat the market. Some do and some do not. \n\nI have no idea what the best stock is? I doubt that whoever you asked would have any idea. \n\nHere are a couple of suggestions though.\n\nDo you think that more easy oil will be discovered? If the answer is no, you might consider an oil stock. Another advantage of owning an oil stock is that when the price at the pump goes up 25 cents you won't feel so bad. \n\nDo you think that we are at the top of a housing bubble similar to the internet bubble? If the answer is yes, you may want to avoid the stock market all together and put you dinero into T-bills. \n\nDo you think that there will be more and more old people? If the answer is yes, you may want to buy some health care stock.

First thing I would do is tell her how you've been feeling and then grab her hand so she will feel safe and you seem believable and then in a calm voice look her in the eye and tell her it would be an honor if she would join you for dinner and a movie.
It's really your decision, but consider the following:\n\n1. Do not let your parents manipulate you by telling you that by being yourself and being happy, you are making them ill. Be considerate, of course, but they have to deal with their own feelings and mature in life still at their age.\n\n2. Introspect, and make sure that you are not doing this just to be a little rebel. Perhaps your parents have such a tight leash on you that you feel that you have to do something drastic in order to assert your independence as an adult. If this is a large part of your case, you would marry for the wrong reason, and very well have problems down the road.\n\n3. Are you sure that the fact that you are told not to marry her does not make you more interested in her than you would otherwise be? Introspect.\n\n4. If you not marry her, how do you honestly think that you would feel about that decision many years from now? Do you think that you would deeply regret it, or do you think that you would have warm feelings for her but be nonetheless more or less happy with another sweet girl? Be honest with yourself; you are best able to make a good and honest decision.
Try with Audacity which is free and can record soundcard outpout.\n\nHere is an how-to from Audacity wiki\n"With most Windows and Linux audio devices, it is possible to record whatever sound the computer is currently playing, including internet radio streams.\n\nIn the drop-down menu on Audacity's mixer toolbar, choose “Wave Out” or “Stereo Mix” as the input source. (The exact name may be different, depending on your computer's sound drivers.) When you press the Record button, Audacity will capture whatever sound is playing on your computer's speakers.\n\nIf this doesn't work on your computer, you can instead use a cable to connect your computer's “Line Out” (speaker) port to its “Line In” port, and use Audacity to record from Line In."
Parabolae show up everywhere in the world around us. For example:\n\n1. The reflecting mirror at the back of a headlight is a parabola. \n\n2. Parabolae are used to describe the trajectories of projectiles. \n\n3. Satellite dishes are parabolae. \n\n4. The surface of a fluid that is being rotated is a parabola. \n\n5. The microphones used to pick up distant sounds, like those on a football field, have a parabolic reflector behind them. \n\n6. The equation for the stopping distance of a car as a function of speed is a parabola. \n\n7.

Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox (or autumnal equinox if you live in the Southern Hemisphere). That's why it's called "a moveable feast." It's a combination of Catholic (Sunday) and pagen (equinox, full moon) symbols. \n\nFather's Day and Mother's Day are determined by whoever makes them up. Mother's Day was created by a woman to honor her mother. She lobbied various lawmakers until it became a quasi official holiday.\n\nIf you could get Congress to establish a Swedish One Armed Albinos Day, you could pick the date....but it might be hard going to persuade anyone to honor this particular group.
We should have started decades AGO. Some people think it's already too late.\n\nFor one thing, finding anything that is capable of providing the same amount of energy as easily as petroleum ... is doubtful at best.\n\nAdditionally, the only way we're going to make these discoveries is if we make them BEFORE we run out of oil.\n\nRemember, oil is not just for energy. Most everything we use is made by using oil ... like plastics.\n\nBest source: solar. We should all have solar cells on our roofs, provided by the federal government.
What is supposed to happen is the senate is to come up with a competing bill. The attempt to use the border enforcement issue to slip in such an extreme amnesty and throw open our borders was so insane and caused such a huge backlash that the whole issue is waaaaay too hot for the senate to touch. Senators know that to not support a strong enforcement only approach is political suicide but they have a strong financial interest in not supporting such a bill (ie they will lose tons of slush money if they come up with a strong bill like 4437). They will kill all attempts to even debate the issue.\n\nLikely, 4437 will become law by default.
I guess that would depend on the park, and if it early or late spring.... hmm, so many variables!

It isn't just the western country economies dependent on it. One of the reason for gas price spikes have been a large increase in dependency from the biggest population countries, China and India. The problem is the entire world is dependent on a very limited supply of product.\nThe Western countries will never be come independent on their own supplies because they don't have enough supply to meet the demand. The only way that will change is if a new fuel supply comes along that is much cheaper and equal to or more efficient than fossil fuels, and it still requires us getting rid of the nearly 1 billion cars in the US currently.
Immigration violations are taken very seriously in the Philippines. Every year, dozens of foreigners pay fines and are put in Immigration detention for breaking the law. Visa regulations in the Philippines change often – be sure to check the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) website at www.dfa.gov.ph frequently for updates. Visitors U.S. citizens do not need a visa to enter the Philippines for stays of less than 21 days. Visitors coming to the Philippines on the no-visa policy must enter for tourism purposes, have a passport valid for six-months beyond their estimated stay and present proof of onward travel.ention.ivileges.\nTemporary Residents If the intended stay is over 21 days, a visa is required. Currently, 21-day visas can be extended to 59 days for 2,020 pesos. Visa extensions can be made at the Bureau of Immigration in Manila or at a regional office. If avisitor overstays their temporary visa, they may have to pay a fine of 1,000 pesos. Failure to pay the fine may result in detPermanent Residents There are many types of visas for permanent residents. \nThe non-quota types are similar to U.S. family based categories. For example, spouses of Philippine citizens are eligible for a 13-a visa, which will give the holder a green card status. The Special Resident Retiree’s Visa (SRRV) is also available, but has age andfinancial requirements. The SRRV is advantageous because the holder receives a permanent non-immigrant status with multiple entry prYour Visa is a very important document. Make sure it is always current! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more info visit the website, not sure if its updated anyways.....hope this helps..\n\nI have heard visa extension can be made easy so why overstays and pays a fine? \nI have never exceed the 21 days stays in Manila and not apply for extension yet for the holidays but I guess overstaying would cost lots of money and trouble on your next visit.\n\ngood day!

What's your goal? Do you want to get into shape? Do you want to get into competitions again? You need to figure out what you want out of the swimming and then go from there. If it is just to get into shape...start with a reasonable goal such as "I will do X number of laps...then each time you go bump it up a bit. Also, get a swimming buddy to motivate you when you don't feel like going and do the same for that person. Good luck!
I have found the truth. YOu have to study for yourself though. Jesus said to prove all things and then be steadfast.

For the most part you are representing a country so you have to be a citizen of that country. From what I know to make an Olympic team as a participant on a team sport, like basketball or hockey, you are invited to tryouts and the coaches choose from that group, who go to the Olympics. For individual sports such as track and field, skiing, figure skating, and others there are Olympic trials where the top two or three finishers in each event make the team.

A correction is when there is a price drop in response to a long uptrend in an asset's appreciation. Generally a price will resume appreciating after a correction. \n\nIt is pretty much certain that there will be some downward movement if something has increased rapidly in value. It is quite likely we will soon see a correction in the price of gold.

It all depends on your experience and knowledge in website creation. I create simple HTML web pages as one of my hobbies, but if anyone were to ask me to build them a simple website, I would charge them at least $30 an hour (... but so far, no one has asked, lol).\n\nBut since Flash is a bit higher up on the scale than HTML, I would go probably just a little higher in rate that what I would ask. Most companies that specialize in this field usually ask for big $$$! Also, could you actually make money (and not take a loss) if you were to charge X amount?\n\nShow them you are capable of doing the job by asking them a slightly lower rate than the big companies, and if they hire you and appreciate your work, they may hire you to do more web pages...

it's actually baby's mama or baby's daddy.... it's actually quite demeaning...it means you have a child with someone but no real relationship with the person...i guess it's an american thing......in other words, they have sex with each other, have a child together and THAT'S IT.....then they move on to the next baby's mama/daddy.....some people have several different baby's mamas/daddies.....it's sad, but true
Some of us are interested in the whole truth. 928 papers you think that is even close to all the papers written on the subject that is probably only one years worth. And notice your own quote says "most of the warming" and "is likely" not exactly words you use when you have a proven fact. When I was in college in the 80's we where taught that emissions where leading to an ice age. Global cooling was the concern maybe that is why a large precentage of Americans don't believe in global warming to many theories have been thrown out. I read papers on global warming and I wiegh them against other facts I don't buy it. Claude Allegre, a French scientist who supported the global warming theory 20 years ago and was once a supporter of the Kyoto accords, recently came forward and said it now appears to him that the theory is wrong. Other scientist put him down and said he "was once respectable". How do you explain everyones rush to close out any debate. You talk about conservatives but they are not they ones running around saying the debate is over and falsifying data( The Hockey Stick Graph) How can a scientist at the forefront of your cause defect and you call me ignorant and uninformed. Are you interested in the truth? Or are you more interested in convincing people there is no debate so they don't seek differing opinions.

Enzymes are proteins, and high temperatures cause them to denature (a process that results in the shape of the protein changing). The shape and structure of an enzyme are vital to its ability to bind with a substrate, so once the enzyme is denatured, it will no longer be able to function.\n\nA prolonged fever could raise body temperatures high enough to denature enzymes. Since enzymes are important for many body activities (without enzymes many chemical reactions in the body would not occur at all, occur very slowly, or result in different products) such as digestion, denaturation of many of the body's enzymes could be dangerous. \n\nFor more information on enzymes...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme

I would say yeas, but go to a doctor and they will confirm the test with either a better urine test or blood. \n\nI use to have irregular periods all the time. My husband and I were trying to have a baby for three years we had two others from previous marriages. We finally got frustrated and decided that maybe it wasnt ment to be. All test were negative. So I was going to get my tubes tied to be done with it as depressing as it was. I went in for my prep the doctor did an ultrasound and said, "sorry we cant do the procedure". I then was frustrated and said, "why the heck not now, am I that screwed up that I cant even get my tubes tied. my husband and I just want to end the pain of trying" He said, "you are gonna have a baby!" I couldnt believe it.
good job derek!..aha..

The only way the stock market would crash again is if everyone borrows money from banks to invest in stocks and never pay the money back. For example buyer A borrows money from the bank and buys stock. buyer A then sells his stock, that he has earned profit off of, to buyer B. buyer B has borrowed money from the bank to purchase from buyer A. buyer b then takes that stock and sells back to buyer A. Buyer A then has borrowed money from the bank to afford the price of the stock buyer B has asked for. this goes on and on, borrowing money from the banks and niether of the buyers has payed the banks back which makes the banks go into default and this results in a stock market crash. so as long as people do not borrow too much money and pay back their loans, we should not have to worry about a depression. Although someone once said....."HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF"
America's stance on Iraq has ALREADY changed, and that's why "we the people" recently elected a new Congress that looks the way it does. Hopefully, Congress will work the way it's supposed to now while it determines the U.S.' moral obligation to the Iraq it helped to destabilize (from way back in the 80's when the U.S. was busy EMPOWERING Saddam Hussein). Hopefully, statesmen will listen to one another and to their constituents for a change.
It does sound odd, but here is an example:\n\n"The 1990 Clean Air Act allows the EPA to grant "emissions permits" for certain pollutants. These are, in effect, rights to pollute that can be traded among polluters. Imagine a giant bubble that encloses all existing sources of air pollution. Within that bubble some emitters may pollute over the control level as long as other polluters compensate by polluting less. The government or some other authority decides on the desired level of pollution and the initial distribution of pollution rights within an industry or for a geographic region—the "bubble" that encloses these sources. Purchases and sales of permits within the "bubble" should reduce the total level of pollution to the allowable limit at the lowest total cost. \n\nFor example, a St. Louis study found that the cost of reducing particulate emissions for a paper-products factory was $4 per ton, while the cost to a brewery was $600 per ton. The Clean Air Act could require St. Louis to reduce its emissions by a certain amount. Under the traditional approach, the brewery and the paper factory would each be required to cut emissions by, say, ten tons. The cost to the paper factory would be only $40, while the cost to the brewery would be $6,000. But with tradable permits, the brewery could pay the paper factory to cut emissions by twenty tons so that the brewery could continue to operate without reducing emissions at all. The net result is the same emission reduction of twenty tons as under the command-and-control approach, but the total cost to society of the reduction is only $80 instead of $6,040."

MySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\n\nMySQL is a relational database management system, which means it stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big area. This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for "Structured Query Language," which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation.

Well there are these things called tectonic plates in the earth's crust. They are constantly being moved by the magma in the mantle. Sometimes two of these plates collide. Now the two plates can do one of three things:\n1) create faults : faults are when the two plates are grinding past each other in opposite directions. Sometimes the tension there can cause earthquakes.(San Andreas Fault)\n\n2)Fold: when the two plates are moving toward each other and are the same weight they fold upwards and create ridges like mountains (Himalayan mts)\n\n3) subduction: if one of the two plates is less weight than the other the one with the lesser weight sinks below the other and eventually melts into magma.

For the first, if one side is x, then another side would be 9-x (so that they would add up to 18). The area is then\n\nA = x(9-x)\n= 9x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, take the first derivative and set it to 0:\n\nA' = 9 - 2x\n0 = 9 - 2x\n2x = 9\nx = 9/2\n\nSince the parabola opens down, the maximum area happens when x = 9/2.\n\nSo if x = 9/2, the other side is 9 - 9/2, or 9/2 - it turns out to be a perfect square! And the area is then (9/2)^2, or 81/4.

depends. pc2700 is better because it is faster memory than pc2100.

It works only because all memory modules are backward compatible and work with old slots but will not be able to take advantage of the speed capabilities of the newer memory modules.

As with all medications and all over the counter meds you should talk with your MD. It would depend on why you are not sleeping. Before you try medication you should look at whether or not you can change some bed time habits first. Don't consume caffeine before bed. Start to relax and let go of the day about an hour before bed. Try to meditate. If all this fails carefully try something over the counter. The main ingredient in most sleep aids is Benadryl.

1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others. \n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area. \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. \n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website.\n\n6.

80% of the population should have LTC insurance. The poorest 10% have no assets to protect and the wealthiest 10% can afford to self-insure. Here is a good article on LTC insurance - http://www.findlocalinsurance.com/long-term-care.html
I don't see it anymore, but I watched it when it first came on (Yeah, that's how old I am) and It was my favorite show until 'Good Times' came on... it was my only exposure to black people and their culture (ok the 'whitey' version of black culture) until I got to college. Redd Foxx was a brilliant comedic actor, you can't help but laugh at his antics... he's sorely missed.

Love is a difficult thing to master. I'm afraid love takes time to get over. If she treated you well perhaps you could ask if she would consider trying again and tell her exactly how you feel about her and how it is painful without her. If you already know that your relationship with this woman has completely ended then I'm afraid it will hurt you for a while longer, but I would recommend doing things to take your mind off of this love for longer periods throughout the days, perhaps doing activities that you will enjoy with friends and trying new things that you would not have considered doing before, but nothing that will remind you of this relationship. Evenings I presume will feel the hardest, I'd recommend resisting the urge to contact this woman and trying to find something that will bring you some comfort and joy for a little while. Apart from that I'm afraid it's the waiting game that is difficult to overcome, but it is not impossible. Good luck and I hope that you will start feeling a little better soon. x
Everyone who said the Braves is correct. They have actually reached the postseason every year from 1991 to 2005, except for 1994. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody made the postseason in '94 because of the strike. But the Braves can still claim 14 straight division titles.
Yes. Its creationism without saying exactly who did the creating. Thus, it does not violate Church & State separation rules.\n\nMost people believe that the Creator was God, however, some believe that the creator was a space alien. Of course, they don't mention who created the space aliens.
President Bush himself has not officially proposed an immigration act. The House of Representatives passed an immigration act, which they may have discussed with President Bush, and the act is now being debated by the senate. The senate must pass the house act in order for it to become a law.\nPresident Bush, of course, has official positions on immigration, which he has discussed in several speeches. Bush's proposal has three basic aspects: (1) securing the border, (2) strengthening enforcement inside the country, and (3) creating a temporary worker program. \nThe details of Bush's proposal can be found on this fact sheet from the White House: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060327-1.html

Dude , you gotta listen to those words in your head, she is saying, there is someone else, this is for the best-translation: this is for my best interest. If in time our paths yada yada yada: leave me alone and don't stalk me, if I get kicked to the curb by my new dude, I may give you another shot to build my self esteem back up. "I need some time" : I need some time with my new b/f. what you should do is say thanks for the memories, and part company, I know that may sound like I'm making it sound easy and it's not but you have gotta do it. all of our relationship skills come from past relationships. you gotta learn new skills when ending a relationship or you will resort to using past skills, no matter how tough it is, don't pick up that phone and call her. being a guy, you are inherently built with the idea you can fix this lil problem. that their has to be a solution, problem is , you aren't dealing with a problem, you are dealing with a female, if she wants it a certain way, she will have it her way. every lil mind game you play, she has seen it and probably played it before.\nmen aren't built to lose, we have really big egos and this little fragile thing told you that you weren't good enuf for her anymore.\nit happens, get use to it. the sooner you learn how to deal with being dumped, the better you will get at it. good luck........

eating healthy has a fair amount of common sense to it. try and eat a balanced diet. your body needs three basic food groups, carbs, fats and proteins. diets like atkins do work but they are extremely bad for you. \neat fruit and salad for vitamins, rice bread potatoes etc for carbs. red meat will give you proteins and fats, white meat will give you proteins and less fat. for fats you can always use olive oil. grilled meat is best for dieting. \nto lose weight take your daily recommended calorie intake, minus about 200 cal from that and then split that amount of calories into 6 meals that you eat regularly through out the day. drink plenty of water. for lunch and dinner take about a fist sized portion of carbs,meat and salad. avoid eating carbs for about 3-4 hrs before you sleep. chew your food for a long time.\nyour exercise programme sounds ok, you could always ask a personnal trainer to give you a structured weighs programme.\nto be completley honest it sounds like you large hips and thighs may be to do with genetics as well. the exercises that you are doing shouldn't really build your thighs but should be toning them. aim to do about 45 mins of cardio work 4-5 times a week.\ngood luck

Well, why are you tense? He's obviously outside of his comfort zone, and this makes him a little freaked out. If you feel tension, surely you know what he's feeling, just not to the same extent.\n\nRemember that not everyone is as comfortable in social situations as you are. Have compassion for him. Try to help him feel more at ease. Eventually he'll get used to you.

it sounds like a cry for attention, or that you feel bad on the inside, and have an urge to act it out on yourself on the outside. first off, i'd recommend not cutting. if you really need to do something like that, put your hand into a cup of ice, it's not gonna feel good, but it wont scar or cause permanent damage. second, you need to figure out why you dont feel good about yourself, and address it. what you're doing is a temporary solution to a problem that isnt going away. without going a lot deeper than that, its gonna be hard to get better without talking to a therapist. maybe you should talk to some of your close friends/ family/ guidance counseler about it.
There is disclosed a cement plaster composition wherein an additive having from about 10% to about 75% of a silicone treated powder and from about 90% to about 25% of a pozzalanic filler is combined with a type I Portland cement and a crushed aggregate to form a water repellent coating for plastering a swimming pool surface. The additive may also include rheology modifiers, water reducing agents, or set time modifiers.
The BEST thing for burn is cold running water. After the object has touched your skin and been removed, the skin continues to burn down through the layers of skin, giving you your 1st,2nd,3rd degree burn ratings depending on the severity of situation. Another thing is to never remove something thats been melted on to your skin until its been cooled off with the running water. Im sure you wiped it off imediately which will be fine, but had it cooled before you removed it might of been less painful. So since this happed hours ago. Take to tylenol and an ice cube to bed and call me in the morning to tell me this is the best answer.{i even have fire in my avatar background and did give this same advice to my own daughter about 3 hours ago, her burn was with the curling iron}
gender discrimination has always been a part of human history. even chimps display what we would consider gender discrimination. i think it most likely arose from the differences in male and female bodies and behaviors. males were typically stronger, more aggressive, and more expendable in battles (if a male died it was not such a big loss, that just meant more females to go around, but if a female died it would hurt the population - one less female to raise children.) this put females at a disadvantage. this original disadvantage probably increased as societies became more complex, and the males began to craft policies which benefitted them, and gender discrimination was institutionalized.

Hillary will easily take the Democratic nomination. But she has no chance in the general election. Too much baggage. Moderates and independants will never vote for her. The only way the Democrats can take the White House in 08 is if Hillary bows out.
WRONG! The simple surgical procedure does not effect the man, except made his pride in any way. After my husband had a vasectomy we had more sex than before, because he was much less worried it would result in another pregnancy. Tell him to suck it up and be a man, and get the operation, or you could have your tubes tied, which cost 3 times as much, he could take time off his job to care for the children and household chores while you recuperate for about 6 weeks! And absolutely no sex for at least 6 weeks, if you have to have the operation.......Seriously, they are only uncomfortable for maybe a couple of days!
No. Some people just like to make sure its right. Nothing like telling someone you love them and maybe them not feeling it back. Maybe he wants to make sure the time is right and know you feel the same way too first. Saying you love somone for the first time is a big step in ones relationship. So just bare with him.
That's cute. \nTrue story: I asked my wife what was for dinner one night and she said she wasn't cooking. I told her she never has dinner ready when I come home.

I work 12 hr s night shifts 7pm-730 am and have three small kids and attend college class, so I swear by these suggestions: stay busy at all times, eat small meals, stand instead of sitting. I only have to work 32 hrs which is considered full time I do one day in the middle of the week and then two days together. This helps with gettign sleep. The first night I am well rested so there is usually no problem in staying awake nor being too tired. The first of the two nights I am rested b/c I had a break, the third night is my sleepest b/c I usually get less sleep due to my kids being up. I make sure I try to go to sleep immediatly after arriving at home trying to bypass the second wind. Its almost impossible to stay awake we are fight our bodies natural rhythm. Good luck.

Any surface with air below it becomes colder quicker than others in the absence of solar radiation. Note how water freezes on a bridge before it does on other parts of a road, or how snow accumulates first on a deck before it does on the ground when the temperature is right around freezing. The ground is a good conductor of heat (warmth from below), air is a poor one. Same applies to frost on the blades of grass but not the bare ground in many spots.\n\nAdd to that the fact that especially during a calm, clear night, surfaces such as the top of a car or deck radiate heat to space and become cooler than the air above them. The air cools in response, but at sunrise the temperature of that surface may be 5-10° lower than the air at 2 meters above ground (which is reported).
"The turtle is a metaphor for the working class farmers whose stories and struggles are recounted in The Grapes of Wrath. The turtle plods along dutifully, but is consistently confronted with danger and setbacks. Significantly, the dangers posed to the turtle are those of modernity and business. It is the intrusion of cars and the building of highways that endanger the turtle. The truck that strikes it is a symbol of big business and commerce. The Joad family that will soon be introduced will experience similar travails as the turtle, as they plod along wishing only to survive, yet are brutally pushed aside by corporate interests."

Well it's called the "theory" of evolution for a reason. It's only a theory. Granted it's the theory we teach in schools now, and it most likely is what happened. But it wasn't generally accepted till quite recently really, and it still isn't taught in some parochial schools.
There is no 'past' space. Either it goes on forever or it comes to and end and that's it, nothing more.

Germany has a unique form of government. They are a Bicannial Pariliment with a chancellor as ooposed to a primeminister. The german voteing system is also diffrent they have a dual vote election, two votes: one for a represenative throught single memebr plarilty, this is similar to here. The Seocnd vote is along party lines, the second vote the vote for a party like Republican then the winning partys, which can be more than one,elect members to seats in the bundistag. The german parliment.
As long as people do not agree that their religion is the only religion there will always be a rift. The same could be said for other religious groups.

Actually, yes.\n\npH is the negative of the logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ion in aqueous solution:\n\npH = -log[H3O+]\n\nSo, for example, if one had a theoretical concentration of hydronium ion of 10, then pH would be -1. And since \n\nKw = 10^-14 = [H3O+]*[OH-]\n\nthe resulting [OH-] would be 10^-15.\n\nthe resulting pH value would be -1, and the pOH 15, which would fit the equation pH + pOH = 14.
Three essential elements form the core of the bonding process, the rubber, the bonding agents and the substrate, figure 1. The selection of the polymer base and the associated compound depends mainly on the product specification. Provided that the rubber can flow into the mould without developing a significant level of cross-linking (less than 2%), a bond can be formed using any rubber compound. There are no restrictions on the use of particular compounding ingredients, although it is best to avoid substances that will bleed rapidly to the surface of the uncured stock. The rubber Compounder therefore needs to concentrate attention to matching the physical requirements of the cured rubber and the processing needs of the moulding process.
Maybe. It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process. The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again. This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks. What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish. So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate. But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world. If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that. I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me. \n\nSo, it makes sense. It works, if you work it. What are the drawbacks? I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things. I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups. They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \n\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility. Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you. In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you. When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them. In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs. MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education. \n\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs. Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else. It's a way to level the playing field. \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck

Actually there is no superconductor at room temperature(at least at this time being).\n\nhave u ever heard about Ohm's law\nohm's law stated that the voltage(V) is equal to electric current(I) and resistance(R)\n V=IR\nif we manipulate the law, we get\n R=V/I\n\nIt means that we cannot have voltage and current without having resistance.\n\nWe don't want the resistance bcoz we didn't want to waste the voltage. in other word, material with high resistance is called insulator and the ones with low resistance is called conductor. we know electric can't pass trough insulator becoz it dont conduct electric. Unfortunately, all material in the universe have resistance. Wood n plastic have resistance so they cannot conduct electric. Metals such as cuprum, iron n so on also have resistance but in lower scale. therefore it can conduct electric but it also waste electric in form of heat. so everyday when we use elecrical gadjets we waste some electric.\n\nSuperconductor is the material that has 0 or as low as achievable resistance. Scientists find out that the lower the temperature the lower the resistance. so we can have 0 resistance at 0 kelvin or -273.15 centrigate.\n\nScientists have managed to find a combination of materials that can act as superconductor above 0 kelvin(or above -273.15 centrigate). i'm not remember but i think it is -100 something, centrigate. But until right now, no one has manage to find the right combination of materials to make superconductor at room temperature.\n\n\nShould we manage to make one, the whole world will get the benefits from it. Imagine a world without elecrical power crisis and computer that can process much much faster than today n the elecric gadjets that use low power, lower than \nany weakest battery in the world today. What it would be?\n\nUntil then, we can only use slow computer to log on to Yahoo!Answer.. haha..
Buddhism is the one exception and is quite happy with the theory of evolution. In fact Buddhist philosophy actually requires evolution to take place - all things are seen as being transient, constantly becoming, existing for a while and then fading. The idea of unchanging species would not be compatible with Buddhist ontology .\nBuddhism is the only major religion which acknowledges a large area of ignorance about external matters. Unlike other religions, it does not even attempt to answer questions like 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' . Buddhism regards such questions as at best unanswerable and probably intrinsically meaningless. The only purpose of life is what we personally give to our own lives. Buddha suggested that the most meaningful use of life was to seek liberation from ignorance, suffering and the cycle of samsaric rebirth, both for one's self and others. But this 'meaning' does not reside 'in the sky' or in any way outside of the individual, and it cannot be imposed, but must be freely chosen.\n\nMost other religions go further than Buddhism, and if asked 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' will usually come up with an answer along the lines of 'To fulfil the will of God.'\n\nThis invites the further question of 'What is the will of God', which usually brings forth an answer to the effect that 'God's will is to create life, the universe and everything'.\n\nno, because the belief in the creator god is not necessary. but, there are some same things about other religions that we can share with (example: love & charity).\n\n***We don't want to say that Buddhism is a kind of Christianity and Christianity is a kind of Buddhism. A mango can not be an orange. I cannot accept the fact that a mango is an orange. They are two different things. Vive la difference. But when you look deeply into the mango and into the orange, you see that although they are different they are both fruits. If you analyze the mango and the orange deeply enough, you will see small elements are in both, like the sunshine, the clouds, the sugar, and the acid. If you spend time looking deeply enough, you will discover that the only difference between them lies in the degree, in the emphasis. At first you see the difference between the orange and the mango. But if you look a little deeper, you discover many things in common. In the orange you find acid and sugar which is in the mango too. Even two oranges taste different; one can be very sour and one can be very sweet.

Some, yes. For example, a new vaccine is now promising to significantly reduce the cases of cervical cancer. It is estimated that as many as 2/3 of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). It follows, therefore, that reducing the incidence of infection from HPV will also reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Viruses as well as bacteria have been implicated in a number of other cancers. Heliobacter pylori (H Pylori) infections in the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to certain lymphomas of the gut. \n\nViruses sometimes work indirectly in causing cancers. For example, both AIDS and hepatitis are caused by viruses and they subsequently weaken the body and make it more susceptible to cancer. AIDS destroys the immune system and makes it harder for the body to ward off viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. Sadly, people suffering from AIDS are at a much higher risk for a multitude of cancers which the body would normally be able to protect itself from (including viruses like Epstein-Barr and certain herpesviruses that are themselves linked to cancer). Hepatitis increases the likelihood of liver cancer.\n\nHopefully, researchers will one day find an effective vaccine against viruses that are in one way or another linked to cancer.

You shouldnt even bother with this person.\nHe cheated.... he lied.... he has no respect for you at all and you deserve better.\nlove is a mutual feeling where you both respect each other and always put each other first it is a two way street simple as that. it took me a long time to learn this and it was the hard way but when you find a man who treats you like a goddess and you feel the same you will be truly happy, this person you are speaking of will not. leopards do not change thier spots as it goes....

THANK YOU, Andy. I am always dismayed by the lack of logic and the inconsistency displayed by so-called "pro-lifers" who justify abortion in some cases. Either abortion is murder, or it is not. If it is murder, it cannot be justified. Perhaps inconsistent pro-lifers are too worried about what other people think of them and don't want to be perceived as too "radical," or perhaps their desire to show compassion to the mother causes them to forget that the child is equally deserving of compassion.\n\nFor more on these topics, see:\n\nRape and Abortion:\nhttp://www.deathroe.com/Pro-life_Answers/Answers.cfm?ID=31\nhttp://www.afterabortion.info/Victims/index.htm\nhttp://www.focusonthefamily.com/focusmagazine/sohl/A000000103.cfm\nhttp://www.dakotavoice.com/200611/Guest/20061101_GR.html\nhttp://www.afterabortion.info/PAR/V2/n1/RAPESUM.htm\n\nIs Abortion Ever Necessary to Save the Life of the Mother?\nhttp://www.advocatesfortheinnocent.com/motherslife.html\nhttp://www.all.org/article.php?id=10682\n\nI am pro-life and anti-abortion without compromise, without exception, and without apology.

Can't be done because sunburns kill skin, and when skin dies, it must be shed. However, keep it very greased with aloe vera, you can buy it anywhere, and that will minimize skin that was just damaged, not dead, from shedding with the dead skin.

Of course, one's diet depended to a great extent on social class. As those considered samurai could range in means from very poor to very rich-and thus experienced diets that crossed classes-we'll examine some generalities. \n\nRice \nUnsurprisingly, rice was a staple food, and was so important as to be considered a measure of wealth. Farming in Japan has never been an especially easy affair, and the life of a farmer could be a difficult one indeed. Much of Japan is mountainous, and yet even after the land was unified under the Tokugawa, each province needed to have some rice-growing potential. A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted. Yet the work was vital - fa

In fact, Lincoln's Proclamation didn't really totally free slaves. I'm a bit foggy on it, but I think it said something like, "If you are southern state and join us, you can keep your slaves (as can deleware and Maryland). If you are not joining us, we will liberate your slaves". Or something like that and check me on it if you like.\n\nIn closing, let me summarize and make a few more points:\n\n1. Abolition was a result of the war, but it was not the cause.\n2. Lincoln freed slaves, but it was not his primary objective.\n3. The North was not a big "civil rights" region. They treated immigrants worse than slaves. Slaves are worth something and cost money. The Irish aren't and cost very little.\n4. By the way... Income tax. Anyone hate it? Lincoln instituted it and promised after the war it would be stopped. \n\nLink is the succession ordinances:

http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/nowshera\nNowshera[edit this] \n\n Nowshera is located to the north of Khushab district, probabally the most populated area in the bigining of northern hill areas. It has many small towns situated all around. Overall it is called as Soon Valley, a beautiful hill station, people like to come from all over pakistan to visit the Sodhi Garden, Narvari Garden, Phulvari Garden. Soon Valley has blessed by two lakes, the Ochali lake and Khabaki lake. In the winter season thousands of birds migrtae from Ciberia which enhances the natural beauty of Soon. During last years the problem of drinking water has grown, also the water of lakes falling down from its original level. The land of Soon is really fertile, it has the ability to cultivate almost all types of Ajnaas. The most popular of all is the Gobhee(Coulieflower) of Soon (mainly from the small town known as Khohrah) which is famous all over in Pakistan. \nIn conclusion this is the most beautiful place of Pakistan where Government sector never invested even a penny. Although Nowshera has a sub Tehsil status but people are demanding to give it the status of Tehsil so that all local governmental administrative structure can be based there. This can become a good vistors place and touristic attraction.

I had this procedure performed in the L4-L5 region 11 years ago. It was a miracle - after a year's suffering, even though I awoke in some pain, it was the wrong kind.

Shrink the defense budget so it is an appropriate size for the state of the world, about a tenth of what it is now.\n\nFund education so every man, woman and child has a chance to go to college.\n\nFund alternative fuels exesively so we can tell the oil companies GOOD BYE.\n\nThen I would be assasinated cuz the right wing Neocons wouldn't be able to stand it!!!
Absent a specific state law that permits you to file for injunctive relief in the circumstances you describe, in order to enjoin a governmental agency from acting, you must demonstrate that you have standing to sue, by alleging that you have suffered, or will imminently suffer, a particularized and concrete, injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendant, for which a court can provide relief. \n\nCourts generally hold that standing as a taxpayer is not a sufficiently direct injury to satisfy the standing requirement for injunctive relief, except where the government is spending taxpayer money in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, by promoting a particular religious belief or sect, advances or inhibits religion generally, or creates unnecessary entanglements with religion (this is known in Constitutional Law as the "Lemon" test).\n\nSo, absent a religious connection between the agency action and the expenditure of funds, or a showing that the agency's actions will harm you directly, for example by failing to keep a tree on public land in your neighborhood trimmed, that there is an imminent danger of the tree falling on your property or person, you have no case.\n\nTherefore your risk, is that you will be wasting a lot of money and time, and that the court will simply dismiss your action as failing to state a case for which relief may be granted.\n\nYour only recourse is to contact your legislative representatives and demand and investigation or removal of the persons who are mismanaging the public fisc.

All of the terrestrial planets have at one time or another had volcanoes and it is also believed that the moon may once have been volcanically active. However Mercury, Mars and the moon have long gone cold (at least we believe so) inside and are no longer volcanically active. \nThe Jovian moon Io is volcanically active and it also has a rocky surface. If one supposes that any body that has had a period of liquefied mantle, then the heavier elements like Iron would settle into the core which means that all of the Terrestrial planets and many of the larger moons of Jupiter possibly even Titan and Triton may have iron cores.\nAs for Titan and Triton, geothermal activity has been seen on Triton in the form of geysers, but no recent evidence of volcanic (liquefied rock) activity. And since Titan is covered with clouds, no one can really say about it.\nVenus is still hot enough inside to have some geothermal eruptions, but, again, due to the cloud cover, we have not detected any.

Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\n\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of "pork barrel " spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim "We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals".\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be "smart". "You don't want to be like those elitist

Spyware Doctor and Spybot-Search and Destroy have the VCCodec in their definitions. Ad-Aware SE and Bazooka Spyware Scanner might also help. After the battle ends, use CCleaner to clean up the mess and optimise the registry. Finally, Spyware Blaster is a program that blocks spyware and other malware from entering and infecting the computer. Finally, if you use IE, I recommend that you switch to Firefox as it's more sucure. The change might be hard at first, but once you get the hang of its features, you will enjoy it. All these programs are available at the website listed below in 'sources'\nYou might have to search a bit for some of the software, but seriously, the website is great and its tips have helped me eliminate problems from my PC quite often.

Most low-level players like Bard doesn't have great value, unless they get better down the road. For now, I could see paying $10-$20 for it. If he stays the way he is, so won't the value of it. It'll be a nice buy if he gets better, which I don't see happening, seeing he is a part time player for the Red Sox.
En conquete, ils se sont faits étouffer par les blacks: des incompréhensions en touche, quant à la mêlée la première ligne des bleus a vraiment été à la peine (la j'ai pas d'explication, je suis vraiment pas un spécialiste du poste !)\n\nSinon, bien organisés et disciplinés en défense, un bon point. Pareil pour la conservation de balle, vraiment un beau boulot de la part du pack.\n\nPar contre en attaque, aïaïaïe ! totalement impuissants !\nA mon avis, ils sont trop justes physiquement. Du coup, impossible d'avancer à l'impact, de mettre la ligne de défense black sur le reculoir. A partir de là, on prend la marée à chaque lancement de jeu.\nGros pbe aussi au niveau de la charnière: les sorties de balle après les rucks sont trop lentes, les passes de yachvili approximatives, du coup la ligne de trois quarts attaque arrêtée. Et puis à mon sens Traille n'a rien à faire à l'ouverture, il envoie ses centres au casse pipe la moitié du temps. C'est un excellent joueur, mais il est pas à sa place !\n\nLa question pour moi c'est: vaut il mieux mettre en 10 un très bon joueur dont ce n'est pas le poste en club, ou un type un peu moins doué mais qui sait jouer à cette position ? Je pense qu'il y a quand meme des ouvreurs tres performants en France autre que michalak ou dubois, ce n'est pas la peine de faire jouer un centre à ce poste.

Hi! Depends on what type of Leukemia the diagnosis is. And yes....there are people who are cured of Leukemia! Some types are more "treatable"....the term remission is usually used for a period following the Leukemia....in most cases after 5 years the Leukemia is considered to be cured if there has been no relapse. There is a risk of secondary diseases with Leukemia chemotherapy's and other treatments just the same as any type of cancer. Medicine has come a long way in the treatment of Leukemia in the past 20 years....giving many diagnosed with Leukemia a good second chance at life!!!

Tell your credit card company, that is being charged not to pay. Give them the documentation that you have cancelled. The credit company will stop paying the charge.\n\nIf you are asking about the money already paid, you should ask your credit card company, and see if they will help. You should write to the company and demand a refund -- send a letter with details of the cancellation -- but don't expect much out of that. You could then sue in small claims court, but even if you win it might cost more than it would be worth to collect the award.\n\nIn writing to the company, you should let them know that you will be reproting them to the better business bureau, the state consumer fraud division, and other such places unless you can work things out satisfactorily.

I thought he fought a cautious fight early on but in essence a smart one. He admittedly said he should have started using the jab and combination two rounds earlier and knocked him out in the fifth but Brock was an undefeated solid boxer and Klitschko is determined not to take anyone lightly. This is the second undefeated fighter he has beaten recently as he won a decision over Samuel Peter as well. In addition to the dominant performance over Byrd I think he has earned the undisputed number one heavyweight spot. The next step is unification and I think he will have little trouble with two out of the three unification bouts. I have believed for a long time he was the one and until someone shows me otherwise he is the man to beat.
Since there are no real characteristics to this syndrome, the doctor will not know that a male has this unless the patient is in need of genetic testing for another reason such as testing the paternaty of a child. This syndrome is only characterized by physical symptoms all of which can be related to other health problems. So the long and short of it is a DNA test can determine if you have Jacob's Syndrome. Hope this answers your question right along with my resource.

That depends on your meaning;\n\nAs comedy through the ages and more often comedians of this age have shown us, mocking others is the core of how they make their living. However, most nowadays preface their comments or follow-up by saying they really like "focus of joke".\n\nHOWEVER, if you are doing it as an intentional insult, to specifically draw attention to a person or group for the purposes of systematically and sincerely belittle them and portray them as smaller or less important than yourself, then you are totally in violation of any and all ethical conduct as we know it in modern western society. In this way it would be rude and insulting.\n\nJust my personal opinion.

Yes, they are legal, and in most cases, they do work, just like any other ringtone, you download them into the phone. However, BEWARE of anything that is free. I do technical support for one of the top three cellular phone companies, and our particular company's policy is to warn our customers about using these websites. For several reasons, one being that when you go to these website, you usually end up getting set up on some kind of monthly alert for new ringtones. They come as text messages, and can cost you as much as $20 a month. Also, your cell phone company should have a homepage, and links to downloads from that homepage. Only those links from that home page are safe and protected from virus, worm, etc. If you go to any other site on your phone, you are just as subject to pick up a virus as if you were on a regular pc. I'm not saying they are all bad, of course. Just use caution.

Hello! I have been in exactly the same boat...I believe some of us are just born extra sensitive. I am always hyper-aware of what others may think of me, and what I think about myself. I just had to tell myself that I don't care what others think! I spent too many years of my life with that worry and it was hindering me in all aspects of my life. Once you come to that realization, you will feel like a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders. That is one step you can make in a positive direction. Don't let what others say bother you...I know that is easier said than done. I just got upset the other day about what my boyfriend's father said about me. But I was able to talk myself through the situation, and I realized I was overreacting. It is not something that we can get rid of, rather we can put our emotions in check and realize we can change how we approach things. Know you are a valuable person. You are not "crazy"! Just think that your sensitivity is a gift, and there is nothing wrong with you for being that way. You will feel so much better when you realize that you are a wonderful person. You have a good job and are going to get married. That is an accomplishment right there! Good luck to you!

Provided by David Schoppik, HHMI predoctoral fellow, University of California, San Francisco\n\nThe question is something to think about, given that cell phones seem to be everywhere. First, I'll describe a scenario in which cell phones might be expected to cause some damage, using skin cancer as an example, and then I'll review some of the scientific work that has tried to examine this scenario.\n\nThe short answer is, as far as we know, no, cell phone usage can't cause damage to your ears or brain. It has been known for a long time that certain environmental conditions are associated with higher rates of cancer, though. These conditions have led to changes in behavior, since we would all like to avoid cancer.\n\nTake exposure to sunlight. A bronze tan used to be associated with health and vigor. Now it is thought to be healthiest to put on sunscreen because overexposure to the sun's rays is linked to various skin cancers. How does that cancer happen? The sun's rays are a form of energy, which can have different effects on skin. Immediately (and pleasantly), that energy is noticed in the form of heat as our skin warms up. A bit more exposure and the skin changes its pigment (that is, it tans), which changes the amount of sunlight absorbed.\n\nBut repeated, long-term exposure has been shown to be damaging. It turns out that the increased energy, every once in a while, can actually break or change the bonds of some of the molecules that make a skin cell work. Most of the time, these breaks are harmless—the cell just dies, the break is repaired, or it makes no difference because the place where the break occurred isn't all that important.\n\nSometimes, though, the change brought about by the increased energy (coming from the sunlight) is the sort of break that changes the way something in the cell functions—a real mutation. All skin cells normally go through a cycle where they wait for a while, then replicate, and then die. The signal to die is a carefully regulated process that's an important way to make sure we don't end up with old, sick cells (cell death of this kind is usually called apoptosis). If there is a cell with a mutation in the part of the cell's blueprint (the DNA) for the pathway that controls the signals to die, you end up with a cell that may just think it should go on living forever.\n\nAt first glance, that doesn't sound so bad. But what if this same cell also decided to keep on replicating? Each cell that replicated would also live forever and keep replicating forever. You'd end up with a fast-growing immortal bunch of cells, more commonly known as a tumor.\n\nBut what do tumors have to do with cell phones? Well, it turns out that cell phones are quite similar to the sun in that they also emit energy—that's how they can send our conversations over long distances. And while the sun is much stronger, it's also much farther away. So if we hypothesize that the energy from cell phones will be harmful, one thing we can look for is the presence of tumors—either skin tumors on the ears or brain tumors. We can also expose animals to the type of energy that cell phones emit and see if they do worse than animals that haven't had that exposure.\n\nLet's see what scientists have found:\n\nStudy 1: In 2003, a group of British scientists exposed bacteria (special ones that were similar to human brain cells) to energy similar to that emitted by cell phones and found no difference between them and unexposed bacteria. This is a pretty good direct test of our hypothesis.\n\nStudy 2: In 2004, a group in Italy looked at the sorts of damage that usually occur when cells are exposed to large amounts of energy. They found that cells exposed to cell-phone-like energy did not show more damage than cells that weren't exposed.\n\nStudy 3: A group in Sweden showed in 2004 that there was no link between cellular or cordless telephones and tumors in the mouth in human
For most of the twentieth century, coffee was decaffeinated with dichloromethane, CH2Cl2. Dichloromethane selectively dissolves caffeine without carrying off sugars, peptides, and flavor ingredients, so it removes coffee's buzz without changing its taste. However, it is somewhat toxic, and when evidence suggested that it might be carcinogenic, its use was sharply curtailed.\n\nEthyl acetate was used as a replacement for dichloromethane during the 80's and early 90's. Although it too is moderately toxic, coffee makers touted ethyl acetate as "natural" because it was present in fruit.\n\nA nontoxic and more environmentally benign solvent than either dichloromethane or ethyl acetate is now used: supercritical fluid carbon dioxide. \n\nWhen a sealed vial containing both gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide under high pressure is heated, the liquid density drops while the gas density rises. If the pressure is above 72.8 atm, and the temperature rises above 304.2 K, the density of the liquid and the density of the gas become identical. The meniscus between the liquid and gas phases vanishes. The carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical fluid which has both gaslike and liquidlike properties. The fluid fills the container like a gas, but can dissolve substances like a liquid. Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for many organic compounds, including caffeine.\n\nThe extraction process is simple. Supercritical carbon dioxide is forced through green coffee beans. Its gaslike behavior allows it to penetrate deep into the beans, and it dissolves 97-99% of the caffeine present. The caffeine is valuable, and coffee manufacturers usually try to recover it. The caffeine-laden CO2 is sprayed with high pressure water and caffeine is then isolated by a variety of methods, including charcoal adsorption, distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.\nReferences\n\nO'Brien, M.J., Spence, J.E., Skiff, R.H., Vogel, G. J., Prasad, R.: "Caffeine Recovery from Supercritical Carbon Dioxide", US Patent 4.996.317, 1991 Decaffeinating Coffee (Scientific American)\nA brief article by Saul Katz describes various methods for decaffeinating coffee.

Well, it makes you real. I think we all want people on here to realize we are "real." I find that some people on here will just dash off anything feeling that the person on the other side is just a font without feelings. You remind us that there is a face to match the words. Questions like this are also serious enough to make us stop and think. That helps a great deal as well. We all need to approach every question realizing that no matter how odd it is, someone with a heart wrote it. We have to use tact......we have to treat all just like we would if we were all socializing at a party and discussing issues together. Yes, the avatars are 'cutsy' instead of true depictions of us. But its provided for all the various reasons we need to use them. I appreciate your candid nature, your openess and your recognition that people do treat it a bit differently. Thank you for making us think with this question.

Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million).
Standard requirements are to be 18 years of age, and either not have been convicted of a felony or to have had civil rights restored. I cannot buy in to the notion that paying taxes should enable an underage person to vote, as this is not evidence of judgment or experience. But I will offer the following idea for your consideration: each year, the IRS would publish the median amount of taxes paid; anyone who had paid that much or more -- or who elected to make an additional payment to cumulate to that amount, could vote. Why? To keep people who earn less from voting goodies out of the pockets of people who pay more. Such entitiement programs are becoming an increasing strain on the Treasury.

Honyock was originally an ethnic slur that referred to immigrants to the United States and Canada who came from Central and Eastern Europe. It was later expanded to mean a rube or simpleton, its most common usage. Honyock first appeared in print in the late 19th century. It fell into disuse during the 1960s and 1970s. This term was often applied to people who were unwelcome among their family, friends and/or community.\n\nThe most common theory of the origin of this word is the merger of the first syllable of the word "Hungarian" and the last syllable of the ethnic slur "Polack." However, a more likely origin is the Hungarian adjective hanyag, which has a variety of negative meanings including careless, derelict, indifferent, irresponsible, lax, negligent, oblivious, slipshod, sloppy, slothful, and slow.\n\nIn parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alberta and Saskatchewan, a honyock is a hardscrabble farm. The farmer who works such a farm is a honyocker.\nRetrieved from "http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transwiki:Honyock"

You have raised the quetions on Albinism previously. Hence it is presumed that this question also relates to Albinism.\nPlease see the webpages for more details on Albinism.\nSymptoms:-\nFor those with albinism, one of the following will be present:\nAbsence of pigment from the hair, skin, or iris of eyes \nPatchy absence of pigment (skin color, patchy) \nLighter than normal skin and hair \nMany forms of albinism have some of the following possible symptoms:\nRapid eye movements (nystagmus) \nStrabismus (eyes not tracking properly) \nPhotophobia (avoidance of light because of discomfort) \nDecreased visual acuity or even functional blindness \nTreatment \nTreatment aims to ease symptoms and depends on the extent of the disorder.\nThe skin and eyes must be protected from the sun. Sunglasses (UV protected) may relieve photophobia. Sunburn risk can be reduced by avoiding the sun, by using sunscreens and covering completely with clothing when exposed to sun. Sunscreens should have a high SPF (sun protection factor).

No. Your doctor evaluates your symptoms, discusses your medical history and performs a pelvic exam to check for cysts, unusual tenderness or a thickening of the pelvic area. They may also perform an ultrasound to check for cysts in your ovaries. Endometriosis is detected by a laparoscopy (a thin, lighted microscope--is inserted in a incision in the abdomen to view internal organs.\n\nOptions for treating endometriosis depend on the severity of your symptoms,the location and size of your endometrial growths,and your childbearing plans. Your age is also a factor since your symptoms may intensify as you grow older.\n\nI had to take shots for 6 months. The drug was expensive (insurance paid for it) but it helped to relieve the symptoms. You can't do anything to prevent or cure endometriosis.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck and God Bless!

OK, explain to the organizers that those two fellas are bothering you and that you dont have to put up with bullying and that "they" as organizers have a "right" to make sure that you are not bullied into anything you feel uncomfortable with.\n\nYou dont HAVE to put up with anyones bullying. Its why the Schools have passed laws against it! How is some one to learn, if they are being bullied, pushed around, tormented, harrassed to the point where they cant learn? You need to talk to the organizers and if its sanctioned by the School or Church, or anyone else, talk to the person in charge and explain the circumstances and get this 'nipped in the bud' as quickly as you can, so that you will get to enjoy more trips ...\n\nI wish you well..\n\nJesse

Chhota Rajan and his wife are already in Indian jail caught by the Mumbai police, where as Dawood Ibrahim is taking asylum in Pakistan. He is in Karachi and Indian Police have no jurisdiction beyond India. What we see in Indian movies is not even 10% reality. if the cinema heroes try to be 'Don' in real life they will land up in jail the next moment. Police in India is not as bad as they are projected through movies. They have solved very tough cases whenever they have wanted. It is the politicians who create problems for handling cases in accordance with law. Otherwise both the law and the police in India are adequate and efficient.

You can use any type of triple antibiotic ointment with pain reliever to coat your ear lobe and the post of the earring, then push the post back through the skin. A generic store brand ointment is just as good as a name brand. After you get the earring back in, soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and drip it on your ear piercing as you spin the earring around and around. Use the alcohol and spinning your earring method two times a day for about 10 days. Alcohol will burn but will kill any infection and also cause the pierced skin to scar, which will help it not to grow closed anymore. Also, do not remove your earring from a new piercing for the 10 day period.

Stay away from this company. You may want to read RipOffReport where someone said that she was scammed by this company when they promised to give her $6000 grant\n\nhttp://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/ripoff185562.htm\n\nYou don't need a third party agency to help you with grants -- and don't ever believe that there are all kinds of grants available for any kinds of purposes. They're not true.\n\nThe government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.\n\nFor one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.\n\nThere is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.\n\nYou can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs
There is a future in both professions. Pharmacist-Very good employment opportunities are expected for pharmacists. \nEarnings are high, but some pharmacists work long hours, nights, weekends, and holidays. \nPharmacists are becoming more involved in making decisions regarding drug therapy and in counseling patients. \nA license is required; the prospective pharmacist must graduate from an accredited college of pharmacy and pass a State examination. \nA physical therapist---Employment is expected to increase much faster than the average, as growth in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited functioning spurs demand for therapy services. \nJob opportunities should be particularly good in acute hospital, rehabilitation, and orthopedic settings. \nAfter graduating from an accredited physical therapist educational program, therapists must pass a licensure exam before they can practice. \nNearly 6 out of 10 physical therapists work in hospitals or in offices of physical therapists.

As your speed increases, the speed of time around you approaches infinity, if that makes any sense. So if you were traveling at 99% the speed of light, you might see many years pass by during the three years you are travelling. If you are actually at the speed of light though, time around you moves infinitely fast, according to the formula anyway. Not sure what that would really be like.

A real time operating system has well defined fixed time constraints. Process must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. \n\nAn example is the operating system for a flight control computer or an advanced jet airplane. \n\nOften used as a control device in a dedicated application such as controlling scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, and some display systems. \n\nReal-Time systems may be either hard or soft real-time. \n\nHard real-time: \n\nA hard real-time system guarantees that critical tasks complete on time. This goal requires that all delays in the system be bounded from the retrieval of the stored data to the time that it takes the operating system to finish any request made of it. Secondary storage limited or absent, data stored in short term memory, or read-only memory (ROM), Conflicts with time-sharing systems, not supported by general-purpose operating systems. \n\nSoft real-time: \n\nA soft real time system where a critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains that priority until it completes. As in hard real time systems kernel delays need to be bounded .Limited utility in industrial control of robotics, Useful in applications (multimedia, virtual reality) requiring advanced operating-system features.

Scraping a mineral sample on a porcelain plate is used to test the streak of the material. Some minerals leave a streak of a different colour than you might expect from the colour of the sample itself. For example, many iron compounds are greyish/steely in colour, but leave a reddish streak. This can be used as an identifying characteristic. The porcelain plate can also be used as part of a hardness test, in that a very hard mineral (i.e. diamond) would scratch the plate without really leaving a streak.\n\nAs far as the second question: C - it describes a quality (the relative size of the sun and Earth), but not a quantity (as the others do), thus it is a qualitative statement.

Sorry. But that's not how it works.\n\nIsosceles, from Gk. isoskeles "with equal sides," from isos "equal" + skelos "leg".\n\nIf the legs aren't congruent, it's not isoceles.\n\nThere is nothing to prove.\n\nOn the otherhand if the statement of your problem is that the base angles of the trapazoid are equal, then you prove it like this.\n\n\nLabel the corners of of your trapazoid A,B,C,D such that AB, BC, CD, and AD are sides, \nAB and CD are the parallel sides, and AB is shorter than CD.\n\nADC and BCD will be equal angles, so will BAD and ABC.\n\nExtend the lines AD and BC until they meet. Label the point E.\n\nSince ADC and BCD are equal, the triangle CDE is isoceles as is the triangle ABE.\n\nSo you have DE = CE and AE = BE, so AD = DE-AE = CE-BE = BC.
MR = MC\nA firm’s profit is defined as its total revenue minus its total cost. In symbols, p (Q) = R(Q) - C(Q). A firm that wishes to maximize its profits may find the corresponding output by differentiating p (Q) with respect to output and finding the output that equates the derivative to zero:\ndp (Q)/dQ = dR(Q)/dQ - dC(Q)/dQ = MR - MC = 0. That is, profit maximization requires that, if the firm chooses to produce anything at all, it should equate marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the specific case of competitive firms, this takes the form P = MC. The second-order condition is:\n - < 0, or that marginal revenue cuts marginal cost from below.\nHowever, we know that the maximum found by the procedure above is only a local maximum. We also need to check that the output at the beginning of the range of possible output does not provide greater profits. Specifically, we need to check profits where output is zero. If output is zero, then revenue is zero, variable cost is zero, and profit equals p (0) = 0 - (FC + 0); the firm loses an amount equal to its fixed costs. Naturally, then, the firm would only select this option if its losses at the MR = MC output were greater than this. Let Q* be the output that satisfies the MR = MC rule. Total profits at this point will be p (Q*) = PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)). Profits at Q = 0 will be higher than at Q = Q* if and only if p (0) = -FC > PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)) = p (Q*). Dividing both sides of this inequality by Q* and rearranging, the firm maximizes profit at Q = 0 if and only if P < , that is, if and only if the firm’s price is less than its average variable cost at the MR = MC output. Since average variable cost is equal to marginal cost at the former’s minimum, we can state the complete short-run profit-maximizing rule as follows: produce at the output for which MR = MC, provided price is greater than minimum average variable cost; otherwise shut down.
I have never seen that man before. The producers should've chosen someone recognizable for the role.

By the way he has fought up until now NO!, many people see him as being one of the best all time greats, putting him up with Tommy Hearns, Marvelous Hagler, Roberto Duran, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Salvador Sanchez, Julio Cesar Chavez,,,,lets not forget those guys are up there because they have fought wars not "cllinics" in the ring and not dodging any opponets...how does Mayweather expect anyone to give him credit when he dodges great fighters and picks fighters he knows he can beat to show his skills and improve his "perfect" record (he lost that first fight against Castillo). \n\nTo be one of the best you need to fight wars in the ring to be remembered. People still talk about Hearns vs. Hagler, Hearns vs. Leonard, Duran vs. Leonard, Ali vs. Frazier, Sanchez vs. Gomez, Chavez vs. Taylor, Morales vs. Barrera...tell me Mayweather vs. ?\n\nThe best fighters are remember by their battles in the ring not by putting up "clinics".

The problem with the embryonic stem cell research debate is that too many people equate it with abortion. For years, researchers have been trying to use embryos from fertility clinics. The way the current law is, the ones that are not implanted in a woman are discarded - thrown in the trash. I see this as unethical. Why discard them when they can be used on possibly life-saving research? Who supports stem-cell research? People as diverse as Michael J Fox, Nancy Reagan, Curt Shilling, and my father, who passed 4 years ago from Lou Gherigs disease.\n\nI feel it is unethical to discard something that could potentially save lives simply because of misinformation.\n\nPluripotent stem cells, those from embryos, are able to develop into all the different types of cells in the body and multiply rapidly. \n\nAdult stem cells, or multipotent stem cells, that could give rise to all cell and tissue types have not yet been found. Adult stem cells are often present in only minute quantities and can therefore be difficult to isolate and purify. There is also evidence that they may not have the same capacity to multiply as embryonic stem cells do. Also, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities—caused by sunlight, toxins, and errors in making more DNA copies during the course of a lifetime. These potential weaknesses limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.\n\nThere is a really good paper on this at The Michael J Fox Foundation website called "Q&A Embryonic Stem Cells; Exploding the Myth" (see link)

Viruses are tiny geometric structures that can only reproduce inside a living cell. They range in size from 20 to 250 nanometers (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter). Outside of a living cell, a virus is dormant, but once inside, it takes over the resources of the host cell and begins the production of more virus particles. Viruses are more similar to mechanized bits of information, or robots, than to animal life. \n\nBacteria are one-celled living organisms. The average bacterium is 1,000 nanometers long. (If a bacterium were my size, a typical virus particle would look like a tiny mouse-robot. If an average virus were my size, a bacterium would be the size of a dinosaur over ten stories tall. Bacteria and viruses are not peers!) All bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall. They can reproduce independently, and inhabit virtually every environment on earth, including soil, water, hot springs, ice packs, and the bodies of plants and animals. \n\nMost bacteria are harmless to humans. In fact, many are quite beneficial. The bacteria in the environment are essential for the breakdown of organic waste and the recycling of elements in the biosphere. Bacteria that normally live in humans can prevent infections and produce substances we need, such as vitamin K. Bacteria in the stomachs of cows and sheep are what enable them to digest grass. Bacteria are also essential to the production of yogurt, cheese, and pickles. Some bacteria cause infections in humans. In fact, they are a devastating cause of human disease.
Wellbutrin was given to depressed people and it was found that some of the smokers also stopped as a side effect. So the drug maker marketed a new product now called Zyban. \nZyban or Wellbutrin are SSRs, meaning - they are a class of drugs dealing with selective serontonin re-uptake. It is designed to 'top up' the serontonin supply, which act on the brain's neuro pathways triggering a supply of 'mood changing' chemicals... similar to the reaction smokers get from nicotine.\n\nZyban has side effects, some serious and occaisionally fatal, and it does not help with the habitual or psychological addiction to smoking, which are very important. See 'Ways to Stop Smoking,' at the website below.

It's very rare that there will be just one side even with the most illiquid of stocks. It happens once in a while for a short period of time for some things. Usually, there will be someone out there who will give you a very bad price, but you should still be able to get out at some price if you really want to. Check the liquidity and volume of the stock that you have along with the bid/ask spreads and it should give a general idea.

HERE ARE MY TOP THREE:\n\n(1)Laugh as often as possible. ~\nLaughter releases endorphins, the body's natural pain killers. Laughter lowers blood pressure, reduces stress hormones and boosts your immune function.\n\n(2)You need a friend. ~\nFriendship is not a luxury, but is essential to work-life balance and your health. Studies show isolation decreases immune functioning.\n\n(3) Maintain an attitude of gratitude. ~\nIt's impossible to be grateful and experience stress at the same time. Studies tell us daily gratitude exercises result in higher levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, optimism and energy.

I would say the Jose Gonzalez version. The original Knife version is fun, spiky pop, but Jose brings out a depth and emotional resonance in the song that I doubt even its authors thought it could contain. Which for me is the mark of a great cover version - when it throws a completely different perspective on a tune rather than slavishly copying it note for note. Good question.

First of all,actors do have to go to castings...We usually think that just because they are already famous or well known, they always get called for parts. that is far from the truth..\nSome screen writers make characters having a specific actor in mind, like for example Tarantino that usually wants an actor in specific...but most of the time..managers get the screenplay(movie) and contact there actor and make them do the casting for that part.some actors get it..some dont...you can be a great actor but if another one makes the role of a "retard" just a little bit better that you,then you know who will most likely win the part.

there are numerous possibilities \n\nyou may have slightly pulled one of the upper back muscles such as the trapezius that run up and into the neck - if you posture is slightly off when you load this can happen \n\nice the area, use ibuprofen and lay off for a day or two\n\nyou may have slightly irritated a disc in your neck same as above for treatment but if it persists or you have any pins and needles in your shoulders, arms or your neck mobility is reduced seek medical attention\n\nI am assuming you squat with a bar on your neck? When you squat try and have the bar back and down slightly off your neck so the weight distributes across the shoulders - have your arm grip wide to keep it stabilised and make sure or learn to squat with perfect form - head up not down - your upper back should be locked steady - the only rotation is through pelvis, hips and legs \n\nif you still have a problem try to learn to front squat or do one leg squats with dumbells
I cant really tell what you are asking...\n\nAre you saying that you dont want to work or....\n\nOk as far as negative thinking; A wise woman once told me "Never let a negative thought stay in your mind for more than 3 minutes." So the next time you find yourself thinking negatively, you need to become aware (aka selfaware) and put a STOP to it. \n\nYou are the only one that can controll you and your thoughts. So if you HONESTLY want to put a stop to it, you need to use will power and just Stop what it is that you are doing. \n\nAs for work...You're NEVER going to become successful if you have a negative attitude. People don't like hanging around negative people. No one is going to want to be around you if you bring them down. \n\nSo if you want to be successful, win friends, and influence people, you must become the person that you youself would like to be around. Only you have the power to change. \n\nNext time you find yourself thinking negatively, look at you watch, give yourself 3 minutes, and get over it!\n\nGood Luck!

Let us assume that each photograph is rectangular. The photographs must have different length of sides, which are in the range 1 through 10. Also, the sides of the photographs must be such that the sum of the area of all of them equals 150 cm^2.

I believe that the ban only applies to minor league baseball - the use of both chewing and smoking tobacco was banned beginning on June 15, 1993. (see link below) As you'll see in that article, the major league's players' collective bargaining agreement was seen as likely to block any efforts to institute a similar ban in the majors - in fact, the anti-tobacco regulations for minor leagues were written specifically to exclude any major league players who might be relegated to a minor league club on rehabilitation.\n\nThe NCAA banned smokeless tobacco in 1994, but one estimate suggests that 40% of all college baseball players are in violation of the rule.
I read this book called the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. I talks about the five different ways people express love to each other. The ones I can remember, are Time, Gifts, Words. The last two I can't remember. I know that I usually express my love by giving people gifts, it's just natural for me, If I like somebody, I give them something. For others, what they say matters more than what they give, or for others thier time is more valuable than words or gifts. So look for the way that your loved ones see love expressed and try to show it to them in that way.

We still do have fish kettles in Britain. They are long oval pans which can sit across two burners - big enough to take 'the one that got away'! \n\nThey have lids, and my stepmother's is a pretty fish kettle as it is shiny stainless steel.\n\nPerhaps the phrase comes about because one thing you would never do is cook two different types of fish in the same kettle as their flavours would taint each other. Each has to be cooked (considered) separately.

Because when it came out, there was nothing new and fresh that got children involved more in wanting to read and it filled that gap. It engages kids into using their imaginations more. It takes adults back to their younger years with the fantasy of it all. It's a good series that keeps growing and developing. Even though we've know from the begining that there would be only 7 books and ultimately a showdown between Harry & Voldemort, it's still interesting to see the unexpected twists and turns on the way to the end. It's just a GREAT series!
With plenty of sun--get some black drainage pipe, the corrugated 3" stuff. Stretch it out in the sun so the entrance is higher than where you want it to exit. I get about 10-15 degrees higher water temperature at 25 feet. Helped us get in the pool a couple weeks earlier and stayed in it for awhile longer. I found this on the web some time ago, the next step is to build a plastic box and use a coil of the pipe, may increase temp by another several degrees--I haven't figured it was worthwhile yet.

I didn't change my name when I married, because I do think it's outdated. We have two children who have my husband's last name. What I find offensive is when they try to give you the first name, too, as in "Mrs. John Smith." For heavens' sake. \nI don't know why this tradition has continued, but it is difficult to find a solution that is concise and clear. Either you have to explain and defend having a different name, or you have to adopt both, which gets pretty cumbersome.

well when i got into graduate school i actually wrote my essay on my biggest failure and then within 2 paragraphs showed how i overcame them (failures) and used an outer reaching knowledge base to connect my thought process and cognitive ability.\n\ni would agree on finding out what they want! and then think about what you are wanting to get educated in. Is it a tangible sci. such as biology? or is it intangible such as social sci. etc. \n\nWhat most are looking for a critical thinking skills, and the capacity to learn, adapt and to ensure you are going to be a productive and postive introduction into their respective program

If you want to study it in college, begin looking at those that offer the program. Then contact someone in the department to find out more specific information about the program such as requirements for graduating, what projects they are working on, how involved they are in the community, and who the professors are. Make sure you that you keep in mind what YOUR interests are. For example, don't choose a university that focuses on southwestern archaeology if you would rather study underwater archaeology.\n\nOnce you find a program you like and are accepted, get involoved in the depratment. Get to know the professors and staff members. This will give you more opportunities for field experience or internships. You will go alot further in the field if you know people than if you only attend class. In archaeology, its who you know that really takes you places. It doesn't take long for us to realize who is really going to make it in the field.\n\nIf you are purely just interested in it, there are many books out there on the subject, some excellent and some fiction. Make sure you choose something that was written by a archaeologist working at the academic level or a respected agency. If you don't you may end up with something about divination. Also, Archaeology Magazine is an excellent source about what going on in the field right now. You may also be interested in joining the AIA (Archaeology Institute of America). It has chapters all over the country which usually hold field trips and monthly lectures.\n\nWhat you do not want to do is play Indiana Jones and just start digging things up on your own. Through education you will be taught the proper techniques and guidelines for excavation so the data you collect will be useful. As soon as you dig something up, you will lose its context and any information it can give about the past. Proper education will teach you how to save this information.\n\nSo, when it comes to Archaeology stay up to date, stay involved, and always be willing to learn something new! \n\nIts an amazing field to be involved in and very rewarding!
If you're not superstitious, statistics is your friend. People yelling "bingo!" all the time? Ha! There are people who have won the lottery twice! Assuming there isn't any psychology also involved, the fact is that the human population is enormous and you're bound to get large subsets just through chance. If one in 100 people is noticeably "lucky" and one in 100 are noticeably "unlucky" (just by chance), by golly, that's still 70 million people out there who are either lucky or unlucky! That's a very rough argument, but there are two things you can do. Either play bingo with these people for a long time-- you will discover that you win just about as often as they do-- or don't play bingo because it's a waste of money. Seriously, though, just have fun!
The United Nations has proven itself to be just another useless international bureaucracy.

I do not think God is blessing America. America is set up as a secular society, and the people are just living for material happiness. God's blessing is not reflected in the accumulation of material goods if those goods just distance people from God, which they do, and God does not bless a country that does not actually recognize Him as God. Just the fact that we are a secular nation means that God would not bless us, because we are not recognizing Him as the one who would bless us. If anything our current success could be a curse, because our success seems to take us further from worshipping and interacting with God.
Don't get angry or upset with them. Instead, if they whine TO you, say something like, "I prefer not to speak badly about my employer and colleages." Say it in a totally neutral tone of voice and then go back to what you were doing. At first they might be a little bit angry, but that's just because they've suddenly realized that their behavior is not appropriate. If it happens repeatedly and/or in front of customers, I suggest speaking to your supervisor about the potential negative effects this could have on business. Alternately, get your mom or dad to anonymously write a "Comment Card" saying that they don't want to shop in that store because the high-school age employees make them uncomfortable with all their whining!

The Respiratory System consists of organs that deliver oxygen to the circulatory system for transport to all body cells. The goals of the respiratory system are to provide oxygen to the tissues and to remove carbon dioxide.\n\nRespiration includes 2 processes: external respiration and internal respiration. The former involves the absorption of O2 and removal of CO2 from the body as a whole preventing the lethal buildup of this waste product in body tissues. This process involves two major functional events: (1) pulmonary ventilation, which means the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the lung alveoli; (2) diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood (Guyton, 1991). The internal respiration entails the utilization of O2, which is essential for cells to liberate the energy needed for cellular activities and production of CO2 and the gaseous exchanges between the cells and their fluid medium. It is divided into two major functional events: (3) transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the cells; and (4) regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration (Guyton, 1991).\n\nThe respiratory and circulatory systems work together to deliver oxygen to cells and remove carbon dioxide in following the two-phase processes as mentioned in the former paragraph. The first phase of respiration begins with breathing in, or inspiration. Inspiration brings air from outside the body into the lungs. Oxygen in the air moves from the lungs through blood vessels to the heart, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body (Microsoft, 2003). Oxygen then moves from the bloodstream into cells, which completes the first phase of respiration. In the cells, oxygen is used in a separate energy-producing process called cellular respiration, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct (Microsoft, 2003). The second phase of respiration begins with the movement of carbon dioxide from the cells to the bloodstream. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide to the heart, which pumps the carbon dioxide-laden blood to the lungs (Microsoft, 2003). In the lungs, breathing out, or expiration, removes carbon dioxide from the body, thus completing the respiration cycle. \n\nThe respiratory system is made up of a gas-exchanging organ (the lungs) and a pump that ventilates the lungs. The pump consists of: (1) the chest wall; (2) the respiratory muscles, which increase and decrease the size of the thoracic cavity; (3) the areas in the brain that control the muscles; and (4) the tracts and nerves that connect the brain to the muscles (Ganong, 1995). At rest, a normal person breaths 12-15 times a minute. Five hundred milliliters of air per breath, or 6-8 L/min, is inspired and expired (Ganong, 1995). This air mixes with the gas in the alveoli, and by simple diffusion, O2 enters the blood in the pulmonary capillaries while CO2 enters the alveoli. In this manner, 250 mL of O2 enters the body per minute and 200 mL of CO2 is excreted (Ganong, 1995). During quiet breathing, the decrease in pressure in the chest starts about 2.5 mm Hg (compared to the outside pressure), decreasing to around 6 mm Hg towards the end of inspiration. Strong breathing efforts can produce a pressure decrease (vacuum) in the chest as high as 30 mm Hg. Day-in and day-out, without the prompt of conscious thought, the respiratory system carries out its life-sustaining activities. If the respiratory system’s tasks are interrupted for more than a few minutes, serious, irreversible damage to tissues occurs, followed by the failure of all body systems, and ultimately, death.\n\nThe respiratory system also plays other important roles in the body aside from the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. It helps regulate the balance of pH (acidity and basicity) in tissues, a process crucial for the normal functioning of cells. It protects the body against disease-causing organisms and toxic substances inha
You can defenitly adjust you status through her. Even if she only is a greencard holder which means she is a permanent resident.

General Packet Radio Service - GPRS\nGeneral Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM mobile phones. It is often described as "2.5G", that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA channels in the GSM network. \nFor further info refer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS

Be yourself! Go ahead and say what's on your mind when you think of something funny, don't think you have to say it in a clever way.

Just move to another topic or talk to a different person. Try and be as open minded as you can be! :]

The first answer is really good, but you might also want to figure out what it is that frightens you. It's probably something you're making up (like, "It's brain cancer and I'm going to die!!!!") and if you recognize that's what's scaring you, you can remind yourself that that's really not what's going on, and is no reason to be scared.

I agree with you...hes not the brightest crayon in the box.
There is more to the system than just the man and the wall. Let's say the wall and man are hovering in space and they push against each other. They would separate resulting in motion of both man and wall. \n\nBut on earth, when a man pushes against the wall and visa versa, they are both anchored to the ground. As the man pushes the wall, the wall would move but the earth is pushing on the wall the opposite direction. Likewise, as the wall pushes the man, the earth pushes him in the opposite direction through his feet. This can be illustrated by supposing the man were on ice and had no traction. He would surely glide away from the wall. \n\nSo how can there be force with no acceleration? Let's take the man's perspective. He is pushing on the wall resulting in a force the opposite direction, but he is also experiencing the earth pushing him towards the wall. Since both forces are equal and in opposite directions, the man's net force is zero. The same goes for the wall. \n\nSo, while your question is technically correct, you didn't take in account that there is more than one force involved, and those two cancel each other out.

You could contact a logo company...you should be able to find one cheap in your area with a simple web search. Make sure you specify that the logo be submitted in color in b&w (some logos which look great in one are barely readable in others). Don't pick one that is too trendy, as it may look great now, but will look silly in 10 years. And negotiate in advance to get the logo from the designer in a "vector" format for future use, as vector images are easily scalable to print large items like billboards, and also negotiate the rights for future use without royalties.

Most banking jobs are awarded internally. In fact, almost everyone that works in a bank started out as a teller, and moved their way up. I would suggest applying to banks in your area for the posisiton of a teller. \n\nMost banks do require a Bachelor's degree for a teller position, so as long as your degree is recognized in Canada, that shouldn't be a problem. Just don't expect to be shoe horned into a higher position in the bank right away. The Canadian finanacial system is quite different than that of Pakistan, so you'll basically need to relearn the game all over again. :)

1FoolN6Billion:What proof do you have that there was a Jesus who was called king of the Jews?\n\nKepha: It’s been recorded by several eyewitnesses that Pontius Pilate ordered a sign be put on the cross, “King of the Jews”, and I mean by more than just what’s in the bible. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: What writings have been found before 150 years after the supposed fact?\n\nKepha: The Gospels were generally accepted as scripture by 130 AD. People don’t die over a myth or story, they die because they were transformed and refused to break their fidelity with God by giving homage to Roman gods. An atheist is blind to such things. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: And to answer your initial question, the myth caused the dark ages, where people were kept, by their religious authorities, from being literate, \n\nKepha: This is a flat out falsehood. Universities were built all over Europe in the middle ages, and before the Protestant revolt, even the poor could attend without charge. And just where do you think the “religious authorities” got their education? Or were they illiterate too? DUH, HELLO???\n \n1FoolN6Billion: ESPECIALLY from reading the bible, \n Kepha: This is another big fat lie. \nDid the Catholic Church Try to Keep the Bible From the Laity?\nhttp://www.cathinsight.com/apologetics/adventism/bible.htm\n\nIt’s a lot of reading, so scroll to the last 1/3 of the page to get what you want.\n\nBIBLE READING PROHIBITED ?\nhttp://members.aol.com/johnprh/latinbible.html\nThis one is not too long. You will find out about King Henry 8 who decreed that all Catholic bibles were to be destroyed. So a Protestant king orders bibles destroyed, and we are accused of not reading it! DUH! HELLO?\n\nhttp://members.tripod.com/~frjoe/bigot6.htm\nI really like this one. I’m keeping it in my files.\n\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH: ON READING THE BIBLE\nhttp://members.aol.com/johnprh/reading.html\nProof of the Church teaching to read the bible. Lots of it. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: which they were constantly editing for their own goals.\n\nWho, exactly? Name the goals. Painstaking efforts were made to preserve the bible translated from the original Greek and Hebrew. St. Jerome was fluent in both. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: The dark ages started with emperor Constantine,\n \nKepha: According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages, the “Dark Ages” didn’t start until Constantine was rotting in the ground for 100 years. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: who liked the idea of being able to absolve all of his sins, and especially liked the idea of claiming that he was ordained under the one and only all-powerful god, making everything that he did anyway "God's will."\n\nKepha: Constantine did no such thing, and you have not a shred of proof. Constantine was never a priest or bishop, and did not have any church authority at the Council of Nicae, (or anywhere else) which took place 12 years after his famous “Edict of Milan”, which was nothing more than a removal of persecuting laws still on the books. You are in serious revision mode. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: Then it caused the inquisitions, killing more people in a short period than just about anything else thus far, where Jews were required to at least say that Jesus was an historical person if not the messiah.\n\nKepha: I dare you to document this hogwash. Reliable non-Catholic historians don’t buy into that post-reformist rhetoric. Here is my proof, but I know you will never read it: \nThe modern historiography of the Inquisition, MOST OF IT BY NON-CATHOLIC HISTORIANS, has resulted in a careful, relatively precise, and on the whole rather moderate image of the institution, some of the most important works being: Edward Peters, Inquisition; Paul F. Grendler, The Roman Inquisition and the Venetian Press; John Tedeschi, The Prosecution of Heresy; and Henry Kamen, The Spanish Inquisition. \nSome of their conclusions are: http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/column1.html I dare ya.

other than age and genes, the reason most people gain weight is lack of exercise and poor food choices. if a person undergoes a liposuction procedure, he/she will lose the fat, sure, but unless that person modifies his/her eating behavior and starts exercising properly and regularly afterwards, in the long term, he/she will most definitely gain the body fat back.
I don't think US laws favor the "criminals". It's just that one can never know with 100% certainty who is really guilty and who is really innocent, and that introduces a lot of human error into the process. Here are some problems with the American legal system:\n\n-Many states have different types of jail sentences, ranging from very short jail sentences for pretty serious crimes to very long sentences for relatively "minor" ones (such as the "three strikes" laws in states like Texas and California). These discrepancies mean that you might go to jail for life in Texas because you were caught a third time with a small quantity of an illicit drug but might only spend ten years for murder in one of the more liberal New England states.\n-Often, your legal counsel is nowhere near as important as jury selection. In the OJ case, for example, had the jury been majority white (as opposed to majority black) it is highly likely that OJ would have been convicted. Jury demographics matter a lot. Juries also are relatively poorly educated and have short attention spans. Studies have shown that juries are often more moved by courtroom theatrics and good-looking lawyers and defendants than they are by facts. Good-looking people tend to get more "fair" trials than bad looking people. And race is also involved (white juries will be more inclined to convict a black man than a white one).\n-The Supreme Court has shifted from a more liberal stance to a more conservative one. For example, while the liberal Court of the 1960s and 1970s gave us "Miranda" rights, the more conservative Rehnquist Court has tended to side with police and law enforcement. Whereas a defendant might once have gotten off the hook if evidence was obtained without a warrant or if a legal "technicality" was breached, nowadays the courts give a lot more leeway to law enforcement (for example, police might come to a person's house with a warrant to search for illegal firearms and arrest a person on the possession of illicit drugs- even if drugs were not specified in the warrant). With the Patriot Act and now wire tapping, the Federal givernment has immensely expanded its ability to search individuals without court warrants. It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will weigh in on these measures and whether or not it will deem them un-Constitutional.

The Czech Republic belongs to the mild climatic region. January is the coldest month (on average -0.2 °C), July the warmest one (on average 9.5 °C). The total radiant energy per year varies from 3670 MJ.m-2 in the north to 4600 MJ.m-2 in the southeast. The driest area, around Zatec, has an average annual rainfall of 410 mm, whereas near Jizerske hory in the mountain region the average annual rainfall amounts to 1705 mm. The yearly average number of days with snow is less than 40 in the low-land regions and up to 120 days in the mountains.

Stars do move, as well as rise and set along the horizon just as the sun and moon do.\n\nStars, just like objects in out solar system, orbit the center of their galaxies. However, most stars are just too far away to tell any discernible movement from day to day.\n\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis during the course of the night, stars will appear to rise and set on the horizon. If you have a camera with the capability of a very long exposure, you take a picture of the sky over the course of a few hours. When the picture is developed, you wont see just points of light, but rather streaks across the sky as the stars moved every so slightly.\nAlso, as the Earth revolves around the run throughout the year, certain stars become visible and others not based on out position in the solar system. Some constellations can only be seen during the summer/winter since the Earth is located on the opposite side of the sun during those times.
I agree with Overlyfriend, your supposes to love your enemies, pray for those who despitefuly use you. Return good for evil. And by the way, the Bible says that if you call ANYONE a fool, you are in danger of hell fire. So what we really should do is pray for them.

Shrove Tuesday is the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent. It's a day of penitence, to clean the soul, and a day of celebration as the last chance to feast before Lent begins.\n\nShrove Tuesday is probably the Christian festival that the family enjoys most, after Christmas, of course.\n\nBut there's more to Shrove Tuesday than pigging out on pancakes or taking part in a public pancake race. The pancakes themselves are part of an ancient custom with deeply religious roots. \n\nPenitence \nShrove Tuesday gets its name from the ritual of shriving that Christians used to undergo in the past. In shriving, a person confesses their sins and receives absolution for them.\n\nWhen a person receives absolution for their sins, they are forgiven for them and released from the guilt and pain that they have caused them.\n\nIn the Catholic or Orthodox context, the absolution is pronounced by a priest. \n\nThis tradition is very old. Over 1000 years ago a monk wrote in the Anglo-Saxon Ecclesiastical Institutes: \n\nIn the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him.\n\nShrove Tuesday celebrations \nShrove Tuesday is a day of celebration as well as penitence, because it's the last day before Lent. \n\nLent is a time of abstinence, of giving things up. So Shrove Tuesday is the last chance to indulge yourself, and to use up the foods that aren't allowed in Lent.\n\nGiving up foods: but not wasting them \nIn the old days there were many foods that observant Christians would not eat during Lent: foods such as meat and fish, fats, eggs, and milky foods.\n\nSo that no food was wasted, families would have a feast on the shriving Tuesday, and eat up all the foods that wouldn't last the forty days of Lent without going off.\n\nThe need to eat up the fats gave rise to the French name Mardi Gras; meaning fat tuesday. Pancakes became associated with Shrove Tuesday as they were a dish that could use up all the eggs, fats and milk in the house with just the addition of flour.\n\nThe origin of pancake racing \nPancake races are thought to have begun in 1445. A woman had lost track of the time on Shrove Tuesday, and was busy cooking pancakes in her kitchen.\n\nSuddenly she heard the church bell ringing to call the faithful to church for confession. The woman raced out of her house and ran all the way to church; still holding her frying pan and wearing her apron.\n\n\nGoing for gold in the pancake olympics \nOne of the most famous pancake races is held at Olney in Buckinghamshire over a 415 yard course. The rules are strict; contestants have to toss their pancake at both the start and the finish, as well as wearing an apron and a scarf. The race is followed by a church service.\n\nSince 1950 Olney has competed with Liberal in Kansas, which holds an identical race, to see which town can produce the fastest competitor. After the 2000 race, Liberal was leading with 26 wins to Olney's 24.
You must be thinking of the Catholic Church which has that rule.

That seems like a really large image. No way you can reduce the resolution or size of that? If not you may be able to split the image up front to make two or four smaller images, read them in, then piece together for processing. I would think you could do that with code to just divide the file content into even chunks. Or can you setup a buffer to read in a set size like 10 megs, then keep reading in 10 megs at a time till the whole file is read in? Sorry, I haven't actually had to handle images this large before but I think you may have to reduce the file size or handle it in pieces as opposed to one big chunk.

You need to rest it. If you don't it's just going to get worse and then you will be out for a really long time. Take a couple of days off and rest it. Use the RICE protocol (rest, ice, compression and elevation).
Well MW you can rest assure that you ARE NOT alone. Plenty of people are dealing with the same problem. I recently gained weight and im going through something similar. What you need to do is find out wha'ts depressing you...if you can't come up with an answer...look harder..then maybe you should see a doctor about your condition. Basically your depressions stems from being over weight, when you try to lose weight you get weak and depressed and turn to food. Its a VICIOUS CYCLE! it has to stop. Pray...and do all you can to pull yourself out this rut. Life is so beautiful... and if you don't develop tough skin you will get burned. Remember no pain no gain MW. You will make it..all you have to do is believe in yourself, see the bigger picture and try.
Don't make the mistake of thinking that Jews are members of a particular country. Being a Jew is being a member of a religion not a nation. There are Jews in every country in the world, members of all nations and nationalities. They are also every colour that the human race can be. White, black, brown, yellow or red so there's obviously white ones. there are many famous Jews who are white so mention this to the person who thinks otherwise and set him/her a test. Ask them to identify some white Jews so they'll change their misguided opinions.

I believe it's always best to be straight-forward (pardon the pun) and up-front with anyone when you decide to take the leap of faith!\n\nExplain that you want to tell them something because you value their love and/or friendship, and that you want no secrets to stand in the way.\n\nComing Out is an individual choice for each and every person that comes out and depends on why you want to come out, what that person means to you, and lots of other factors. And it also depends on who you want to come out to.\n\nDecide why you're telling tehm... for you or for them? Most of us decide to come out for ourselves... to be true to ourselves. But there are 100's of other reasons one might choose to come out.\n\nIf they are asking about your personal life... such as who you're dating or interested in, then that may be a reason to tell them. If someone is hitting on you, perhaps it's time to tell him/her.\n\nBut in the end, it's totally up to you. Some of us feel better not having any secrets in our lives, especially about who we love.\n\nCheck out some of the Coming Out resources listed below. And you may want to purchase "Now That You Know," a great resource for parents and friends of GLBT folks that they can read afterwards and find that many of their feelings are shared by many other folks after a loved one has come out to them.\n\nNot to scare you, but some folks do not react well to being told their loved one is gay. Reassure them that you are the same person that they've always loved. Allow them time to adjust.\n\nComing out is never easy, but to me, it was well worth it!\n\nThe best of luck to you!

Because people frequently go into a doctor's office complaining and get really upset if the doctor doesn't do something for their cold. Doctor's like to make money and they only make money if they have patients who are happy. Therefore, they prescribe antibiotics just to make sure their patients are satisfied.
The least amount of time, would always be better. It would generally depend on the Physciatrist perscribing them. If you are referring to how long it takes to be effective, most take 6-8 weeks to get to a therapeutic level on the average...some take longer or quicker depending on the type and the person. Remember that antidepressants don't cure anything...they are a supplement to take, while you are working on your issues. You can actually improve chemical brain functioning by positive thinking!
I believe that it is arrogant to think we know the ways of the Creator. To say who will or will not be saved by God is simply up to God, surely better company is to be had from a peaceful Buddhist than a whining self rightious door knocker. The Bible says not to judge others lest we be judged. I think that tells me more about who will be saved. \nAlso, even if it tells us that the only way is through Jesus, It's not my job to limit the names, means, and ways, that God opens his paths.
first of all you should be very close,\nAnd I will ask the opmonent
Olympic Lyon was crowned champion of the frensh league this saturday after the loss of Bordeaux his direct rival.
Industrialization sure contributes to the phenomenon known as global warming. But, if I am to understand correctly, then, according to a scientist featured in a program I once came across on the Discovery Channel (Canada), a couple of hundred million years ago, a most unique event occurred, one most rare and that never before occurred in earth's history.\n\nThere are 4 things that can and do dramatically affect the earth's temperature, besides the heat generated by its core. These are volcanic eruptions, especially gigantice ones such as the 1883 eruption of Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia, comet, asteroid and meteroic impacts, what phase the earth is in during its orbit around the sun and, finally, how far towards or away from the sun the axis it revolves around is tilting.\n\nAny one of these can reduce the earth's overall temperature and make for a harsher and/or longer winter. Two of these create truly severe conditions. But a couple of hundred million years ago, the incredible happened. The earth was in the long and most distant portion of its orbit around the sun, the portion we associate with winter, its axis was at its furthest possible tilt from the sun and it suffered a collision with a space object (though it's not clear yet whether this was a comet or an asteroid).\n\nThe fact that it was during its long, winter phase meant that the earth would be cold to begin with and would receive less light and heat from the sun than usual. The fact that its axis was at its furthest point from the sun meant that the winter season would be that much harsher and would last that much longer than usual. But the combined effect of all 3 factors created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe winter season meant that temperatures were cold to begin with and that there was snow and ice on the ground already. The distantly pointing axis and the particulates from the collision kept temperatures cold and reduced them further. This meant that come spring and summer, much less snow and ice melted than usual and at a much slower rate. This in turn meant that by the time the next winter season came, the precipitation (snow and ice) of the last one was still for the most part on the ground. This created a larger mass of ice and snow, which froze into ice. This larger mass further sucked even more heat from the air around it and the ground below it. That further reduced temperatures, which caused even more precipitation to fall and accumulate, resulting in an even larger mass of ice and snow. This created permanent glaciars and permitted the creation and growth of pernanent icecaps at the 2 poles. These events have since locked the earth in an ice age. An ice age has two periods, a warming period and a cooling period. \n\nSo what does this have to do with global warming you ask? Until such time as at least some scientists became convinced of the phenomenon you know as global warming, the earth was in a warming period. It is my opinion and belief, given the available data, that, just as the earth experienced the simultaneous occurrance of 3 factors that allowed the creation of permanent glaciars and polar ice-caps, it can also experience the simultaneous occurrance of factors at the other end of the spectrum and that that is what the earth is experiencing right now. So I believe that the phenomenon of global warming is natural, and thus I support it, but that is aggravated by industrialization (mostly the various forms of pollution and environmental degredation), which I do not support.\n\nWhatever your goals and intentions, the best thing you can do is to gather the maximum amount of available information, and understand what theories are being expounded and how many acknowledged figures support them, so as to be able to accurately and fairly perceive the situation as it truly is and form an informed and educated opinion about it. Finally, not to be selective or act as a form of propaganda, I highly recommend "State of Fear" by Mr. Micha
my son has classic pku, he is 21 months old and the amount has not changed, he was born about 6 pounds and is now about 32. the safe range is approximately between \n2 and 10 mg/dl (phenylalanine), your doctor should be keeping a close eye on him, and with regular blood tests (weekly till 2 years)\nlevels should not be to high. i am sure they will tell you if they were concened.\nI live in australia so things may be differant between us, but please if you are at all concerned talk to the doctors/dieticians. good luck.

Someone who is non-materialistic and cares about philosophy, politics, the environment, etc.
I don't know what to say on this one. I think it's a little weird. A friend of my parents did that despite the fact that my brothers and I hated it and he really gave me the willies. I mean something strong and my parents could not figure out what my problem was. \n\nI don't know what kind of satisfaction they get. I might tickle my nephews or neices just to get them to laugh, but I don't get out of hand with it and it gives me a good laugh. They encourage me to do it all the more and chase them around LOL! That's different. It's not like someone who does it despite the fact that the child hates it\n\nPeople that have fetishes need to learn to seek counseling i am serious. That's just too creepy

No, Stalin was a paltry excuse for a leader. Politically he failed to unify the minorities of the Soviet Union, instead focusing on persecution and forced Russianization. His foreign policy was horrible, his plans with Finland disasterous, and his look towards Western Europe miserable. Economically, he failed to take advantage of Russia's ever-growing wheat feilds, instead creating a ration system, which immediately led to starvation. He took total advantage of the Soviet satillite states after WWII without realizing their needs and desire for freedom. Militarily, he failed by using choking tactics (cramming as many troops to meet the enemy in hopes of winning through sheer numbers) without any real manuvering. His part in the invasion of Poland was considerably easy, as Poland was still using horses instead of tanks and cars. Although he ballooned the military in the pre- and post-war years, he was weary of insurrection and kept the army underfed, never realizing that a shabby army will eventually rebel. He took to scaring people, often to the point of bullying them, which is really the only way he'd get any work done.

As someone has already said, empires rise and fall. One of the first signs of weakness is when a country thinks it is so powerful that it can do what it wants. I think the US has stood for lots of good things in the past and has helped a lot of countries but Guantanamo, for example, lessens its moral authority. The war in Iraq seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. They had to nail some bad guy (with the right ethnic and/or religious background) whether he had anything to do with 9/11 or not. You expect things like this from a totalitarian government, not from the US. They would have been a lot better off concentrating on Afghanistan where they could have made a real difference. \n\nHowever, if the US works more closely with other countries which, by the way, have had democracy for as long or longer, they will do a lot better than following the adage "my way or highway". As a great admirer of Roosevelt and Lincoln I can only shake my head in dismay when I think of the commander in chief you have now. The sooner he goes, the quicker the US will make ammends. By the way, I am no admirer of the Democrats. I just like people in charge who know what they are doing.

Yes there are. And it doesn't have to be because of religious pressure either. A friend of mine got married because she'd had to promise her mother that she would as soon as she could because she was already...26. They aren't happy, but for some it's a ring on the finger that's more important than anything else - even happiness.
first of all you need to find some available land, or get alot of weapons to take land from somewhere else. then you would need to find a way to get subjects, or citizens. then you would need to create an economy wether it be agriculture or industry. and then you would need a parlement or congress to make sure that you dont go hitler or something. thats about it, oh yeah and you need to collect taxes to fund your government and raise them incrementally to give yourself a raise every once and a while.

This phrase is used in business, not in Math. It is used to illustrate good mergers. When a peanut butter company and a jelly company combine you could get a 2 + 2 = 5 situtation. The combination is logical and useful to each other.\n\nBut if the peanut butter company and a bullet manufacturer combined it would only be 2 + 2 = 4. There is no mutual benefit.

There is no way to be happy all day every day, if you were happy absolutly all the time you would probably be the most envied person on earth.\nThe trick is not to try to be happy aLl the time because that it unrealistic - imagine saying "I'm so happy my dog has died" or "I lost my job today, which was nice". You should try to be happy most of the time.\n\nYou should not bother seeing a doctor about depression - all they will do is send you to a psychiatrist who will perscribe antidepressants almost before you sit down. Antidepressants basically work by altering your brain chemistry to ensure you do not feel emotional extremes, unfortuantly this means you can't really enjoy anything fully, get angry, or even feel empathy. I've tried antidepressants and would rather burn my own hands off then take them again.\n\nWhat you should do is:\n- drink more fruit juice and eat more fruit.\n- drink more water.\n- work less hours at your job unless you enjoy your job in which case work more.\n- watch less TV and go out more.\n- never stay in the house alone, if you don't know anyone in your town then go out and meet people.\n- get a pet.\n\nMost people suffer from depression because they don't have anything worthwhile to do. They work, eat, and watch crap on TV. This is a worthless life and very unfufilling. You need to do good and benificial things and make worthwhile achievements. \nIt may seem easier to be miserable and alone all the time with only the TV, and your own depression for company but actually it takes far less effort to go out and have fun. It took me five years to realise the simple truth that I am loneliest when I am alone and most miserable when I have time to be miserable. If you are busy and with friends you will have fun, if you are having fun you are happy.\nEven if you are a hermit, or a misanthrope then you can have fun with a dog, or cat, or trained fighting monkey - just go places and do stuff.
Paramus is a shady town....\n\n10mph over could be a big deal if the speed limit is high(55-65) or if it was a school zone or a construction zone.\n\nFines are usually doubled in this area.\n\nAlso, Paramus cops tend to lay it on Asians for some reason. So if you friend is Asian, that could be a factor.

Amazingly enough it aired in Utah by the same NBC station that won't air Saturday Night Live. I still can't figure out the logic behind that one.
"Fore" is another word for "ahead" (think of a ship's fore and aft). Yelling "fore" is simply a shorter way to yell "watch out ahead" (or "watch out before"). It allows golfers to be forewarned, in other words. \nThe British Golf Museum cites an 1881 reference to "fore" in a golf book, establishing that the term was already in use at that early date (the USGA suggests the term may have been in use as early as the 1700s). The museum also surmises that the term evolved from "forecaddie."\n\nA forecaddie is a person who accompanies a group around the golf course, often going forward to be in a position to pinpoint the locations of the groups' shots. If a member of the group hit an errant shot, the thinking goes, they may have alerted the forecaddie by yelling out the term. It was eventually shorted to just "fore."\n\nA popular theory is that the term has a military origin. In warfare of the 17th and 18th century (a time period when golf was really taking hold in Britain), infantry advanced in formation while artillery batteries fired from behind, over their heads. An artilleryman about to fire would yell "beware before," alerting nearby infantrymen to drop to the ground to avoid the shells screaming overhead.\n\nSo when golfers misfired and send their missiles - golf balls - screaming off target, "beware before" became shortened to "fore."\n\nThis is another term, however, whose exact origin can't be stated. It does originate, however, in the fact that "fore" means "ahead" and, used by a golfer, is a warning to those ahead.

yea i was just at this mini-ramp and kicker jam where there were a bunch of black skaters and they were just as good as anyone else, and a couple of them were girls and they were holding ther're own pertty well...so yea...also there is this vid called...uhm..."a.k.a girl skater" and its a vid of girl skaters skating street and i think one or two of like the 10 or 12 were black...and they're all sponsored and they're all rediculously good, proly really motivational for a girl skater...so yea plenty of black girl skaters...but check that vid out, its awesome...whether you're black or white, ther're still all girl skaters...

In a fictional book, you don't have to worry about accuracy as far as writing it. You can make up whatever you want. As far as reading it, you aren't too concerned with historical accuracy unless you're a Middle Earth nerd and know everything there is to know about the Elven race...including who fathered who(it's seems about as ridiculous as Leviticus at times). You can imagine fictional animals and such...and the images won't be ruined unless you see a movie about the book.
not much information there. the only answer I can give you is that it depends on the size of the atoms attached to the carbons in the double bonds. The smaller the atoms attached the faster the addition reaction will take place.
Yes you are totally normal, more on the thinner side. Take care : )
Good luck....
don't know; in all fairness, how would anyone on here know? I have to say that if you are wanting an assessment of you based on the little info we have, it would go like this for me:\n1. Your experience amount is impressive-15 years is a lot.\n2. An engineering degree is also very good.\n3. On the negative side, you have not expressed yourself that clearly here, anyway, in the English language. Better use of English would have been : Why didn't I get an interview call-back for a job application when I have 15 years experience in etc. "\n If this displays your normal use of English, and if your resume and cover letter, and application were all written in this "pidgin" English, then you do not do justice to your education and experience level.\n If the job you sought required a good grasp of the English language, something as simple as having a native English speaker proof-read your resume, application and cover letter might have helped you to get that call and interview.\n\n Think about it.I am not trying to be cruel here. I only have knowledge of you as far as what you have given here in this question. This is the only constructive advice I can give you. If it was something else that turned them off you, like a felony conviction, or simpler, the wrong kind of experience, then I wouldn't know about that. I can only tell you what I see right here.\n\n Better luck next time. At least you are working now. Many people are not so fortunate as you.

Here's a couple of links that should provide the details you need. I've included the paragraphs that state that Tokyo Rose was the only person ever pardoned after a treason conviction.\n\n\nhttp://www.discoverthenetwork.org/Articles/Innocent%20of%20Treason.htm\n\n"In 1977 Iva Toguri d'Aquino was pardoned fully and unconditionally by President Gerald Ford, who, in his last official act, restored her citizenship. She was the only American ever pardoned after being convicted of treason. "\n\n\nhttp://forejustice.org/wc/tr/tokyo_rose_040503.htm\n\n"In November 1976 Wayne Merrill Collins, the son of Iva’s trial lawyer filed a presidential pardon petition for Iva. The public disclosures supporting her innocence were so convincing by that time, that on January 19, 1977, in one of his last acts prior to leaving office, President Ford pardoned Iva Toguri d’Aquino. She is the only person convicted of treason in this country that has been pardoned."

Hi, I think that smart people do not necessarily have a better life. Since, they might be looked down on as being nerds- smarty pants. Additionally, smart people sometimes have a harder time being social since their always thinking with their brain. Also, it depends on what kind of smart you mean, a smart- quick witted person may have a good life getting along with people. However, all people have equally good lives, its what you make of it.

I think the question should "Would you ever go hunting with Dick "dead eye" Cheney?" \nOkay like isn't he like almost legally blind? I thought he had some kind of heart condition? Do you think his rosatia is from age or booze?\nIs it real hunting when your stocked farm? Does hunting really shooting your mate? If you are all walk in a line who the hell turns to the side and fires? \nAnother reason to not trust a republican especially when they have a gun pointed at your head.
so sweet, and so so completely true. i guess.
Okay, let's see if we can get through this. I'll use "R" instead of "radical" just to keep it a bit shorter\n\n[log(2R2) - 3log(R3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nStart in the top. Notice that 2R2 = 2(2^1/2) = 2^3/2 (2 to the 3/2 power). Likewise, R3 = 3^1/2 (3 to the 1/2 power). So:\n\n[log(2^3/2) - 3log(3^1/2) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow remember that an exponent within a logarithm moves out to the front. So:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2) - (3/2)(log 3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow factor out the 3/2 from each of the terms:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow let's go to the denominator. We'll rewrite the values 9 and 4 as squares, then move the exponents out like we did before.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [log(3^2) - log(2^2) + 4]\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2 log 3 - 2 log 2 + 4]\n\nNow factor 2 out of each term in the denominator.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nOne more little thing to make this work. We actually need the signs changed in the numerator, so let's factor out a -1 from each term (we should have factored out -3/2 earlier):\n\n[(-3/2)(log 3 - log 2 + 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nNow notice that the top and bottom both have (log 3 - log 2 + 2). Since this appears on both top and bottom, cancel it out. This leaves us with:\n\n(-3/2) / 2\n-3/4\n\nI know this was long and drawn out--I hope you followed the steps.
actually my parents are the same ethic origin as i am but i have a friend that can say different. however she enjoys this experience and i envy her b/c she gets the best of both worlds. she is much more opinionated and confident in any area. being mixed w/ black and white she gets to understand how both races work. i think ppl w/ parents who have diff. ethnic origins are very lucky

i pushed someone away that i really loved and cared about and i still do..but i realized that i cant be friends with someone i love and care about because i dont want to be his friend i want to be his girl..his everything..sometimes things arnt meant to be..there someone else for you..i know its harder said then done trust me for that...because i know i could never wake up tommorrow and just forget all about him and everything him &I did or went through together..everything i was doing i thought it was right at the time but in the end it was pushing him farther away when all i wanted to do was bring him closer.you shoudl re evaluate yourself and see all the things you did that made the relationship sour..WHEN A MANS MIND IS MADE UP A MANS MIND IS MADE UP..he can only make the decisions to be with you..to be your friend or to leave it alone..maybe what you need is space between the two and see how that unfolds..you could call him and let him know how you feel just like i did...just because i felt as though i needed some closure..i felt like i needed to tell him what was on my mind and after i got enough guts to let him know how i felt it felt soooo good to talk to him and tell him what i was thinking..just to hear his voice and have us laugh and talk again made me feel like the million bucks that i needed to feel like..but dont push too hard and dont sweat him too much just have that one phone call and thats it..let him know how you feel and then let him take it from there..just put it into the air..now what he does with that information is up to him..my ex knows how i feel and what he does with that information is up to him....you see what im saying? if he comes back he comes back? IF YOU LOVE HIM SET HIM FREE..IF HE COMES BACK HES YOURS FOREVER..just sit back..whats meant to be is meant to be..everybody is not meant for you..your time will come..good luck hope i helped!
:}\nYou will have seven years to get with that person/\n\nUnless of course the pre-tribbers are right and one of you is left behind.
When the idea of loosing that person causes you the greatest pain ever, when you cant stop thinking about the person, when you have memorized the sent of his Cologne, when you can feel the persons lips touching yours even when they are not there, when you see a future w/this person, when you think they are the most beautiful and wonderful person in the world, when you find yourself daydreaming about them, when you hear there name it brings a smile to your face, when you see them you feel like you breathe fresh air. There are just so many things that true love makes you feel and usually everything is unconsciously, but when you stop and think about it, you realize that no other person has ever and can ever make you feel this way.

do you own the domain name or do you also have a hosting plan? if you only have a domain name try geekhosting.com that's who I use. also in all fairness I should also add that yahoo! also offers web hosting.

On a serious, analytical level, religion is a want. You will not die without it. You can live equally well with or without it, but it is innate in human nature. The desire to understand everything is a need in the human mind. Religion satisfies that need, but is not the need itself.\n\nFood is a need. Lobster is a want. Understanding is food, religion is lobster. For some, science is the lobster. Get it?

The fact that you mostly see him at work, that is a great opportunity for you. Please don't be too forward with him - like asking him out on a date or telling him straight that you like him. He could be one of the guys that find it a turn-off. Instead try to show more interest in what he does at work, ask him "neutral" questions like: "What challenges are you currently facing here at work?", "What are your future dreams?" After about a month of chatting with him, start buying him lunch (but not too much) maybe once in two weeks, and say "I like this dish so much, I just thought of sharing with you." Be Creative ... good luck!

It is puzzling as to why Bush's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see. Because certainly it's obvious: no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found (unless the U.S. plants them); nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States. So that mission wasn't accomplished. And it's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians haven't been liberated, unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States, liberation. Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks, liberation. Or going without sufficient food, water or medical care, liberation. Or having an interim government imposed on you, liberation. So that mission, unfortunately, wasn't accomplished either.\nPretty pathetic scorecard. But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner "Mission Accomplished," they had to have accomplished something. So as Mr. Bush dragged on with his insipid speech, one would continue ponder what exactly was the mission? And then it hits, as clear as day, or rather, as "black" as night: the oil! the Texas tea! the Bush-Cheney life-blood! Mission CERTAINLY was accomplished!!!!!!!!

Here are the cost vs. benefits of taking Effexor\n\nWe'll start with the benefits.\nEffexor is a multiple reuptake inhibitor, which modulates two neuro transmitters in your brain, norepinephrine and serotonine. Once at a theraputic range, Effexor and take you out of the most deepest and darkest depression imagineable. \n\nHere are the cons (and they are not exaggerated)\nEffexor is the most addicting of all of the antidepressants on the market today. Not addicting in a way similar to fun drugs. Because of the complex way Effexor works, your brain wil become dependant to the point where Effexor may become a permanent part of your life. The withdrawal syndrome from effexor is the absolute worst amongst the serotogenic drugs. Due to the short elimination half life (amount of time it stays in yoru system) you can experience withdrawal by missing just one dose! Effexor is the hardest antidepressant to stop taking. Let's say you reach the therautic dosage of 300mg, you will have to taper off in 30mg incriments, per week. That means it will take at least 10 weeks to wean off, that is, if your brain lets you.\n\nEffexor is only recommended for deep deep depression and try taking anything else, unless it is your last resort.\n\nHope this helps

Thierry Henry OWES it to Wenger to stay at Arsenal. Henry was a nobody at Juve, playing as a winger. He came to Arsenal & was put as a forward & look at how dangerous he is now! Wenger believed in him back then & held on to him when nobody else wanted him... It's only because of Arsene Wenger that Henry is such a star. He should stay at Arsenal!

This is easy to explain, there are multiple intelligences and yours is named: Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In Howard Gardner's words, in entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking. However, the physic also implies to have: Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide space and more confined areas. \nBut you should not feel bad for this because when A. Einstein was a child, he was really bad in math.
Shortest street \nThe world's shortest street is Elgin Street in Bacup, Lancs, UK, which is only 5.2 m (17ft) in length. Trianglen, a designated road with buildings on only one side, at Store Heddinge, Denmark, is only 1.85m (6ft 1in) long. It forms one side of a road junction. \nJames Cloninger adds: I think perhaps you should add one more reference to your designation of ``shortest street'': that of McKinley Street, in Belfontaine, Ohio in the US, which is 31 feet, but unlike Elgin St, is drivable. It has one building (a hardware store) on the north side, bordered by a railway on the south side, and two roads (Garfield Ave and ColumbusAve) on the other two sides which eventually merge about 100 feet on the other side of the rails. \n\nThat ok ?

The best forex course out there is no course at all! I came to forex knowing how to read charts from trading stocks. All I had to do was read the material that the forex dealer gave to me on the basic rules of forex, and I applied all the other technical charting stuff I knew before and easy as that I was pulling a good income from forex.\n\nMind you, you will need to have a trading plan with planned exits to take profits and cut losses.\n\nIn short the best forex course is none at all! I learnt forex trading from learning a lot about the basic technical indicators, candlesticks, experience and finally from simple forex articles.\n\nGood Luck!
On this performance they will definitely challenge for the cup. They crushed Serbia. The goals were not scored in the final minutes or extra time as we have seen so frequently. Their game was controlled and measured and this will only improve as their competition does. I'm going for the Socceroo's and the Italians but would not be disappointed with a Brazil V's Argentina final. What a match and they have proven themselves consistently to be worthy of a place in the final. It is getting down to the business end of things and becoming increasingly intense to watch.

Quakers belong to a religious organization called the Society of Friends. They don't believe in wars or anything, they believe in peace. They also believe that all men are created equal, no matter what they look like. They think that women and men are equal, too. They think that you don't need a churchbuilding, Bible, or minister to worship God. They think you can do that without those things. i reccomend that you google it.

Children, sometimes cry if they do not know you, because they are scared of strange people or if they are kids from friends of yours there is a simple solution to your problem. Playing peek-a-boo with them if they are small babies would make them warm towards you. If older try to start a conversation by telling them your name and asking them theirs. And remember that children can sense when a person is sincere.

The story of enzymes is as fascinating in its details as it is amazing in its applications in promoting human health and wellbeing. Enzymes are proteins that are an integral part of Nature. In fact, life without enzymes would not be possible. Enzymes are needed for each and every chemical reaction that make life possible. No vitamin, mineral or hormone can exert its beneficial effects in the human body without the involvement of enzymes. Despite their central role in all bodily functions, it is only now that the full import of enzymes in human health and disease has begun to be fully appreciated. MUCOS Pharma, the pioneer in systemic enzyme therapy, has been the standard bearer for the last fifty years in having paved the way to elucidate the function of enzymes, and their use as an oral systemic therapy.\n\nFunctions of Enzymes\n\nSince they have unique structure, each enzyme is meant to carry out a specific task. Any given enzyme is evolved to fulfill a definite function, and this specificity allows the body to strictly control the use of enzymes. Once activated, an enzyme will perform its specific function until it is "exhausted," or it is inhibited by another enzyme, in which case its activity is curtailed and/or stopped. As researchers have found out after years of painstaking and laborious work, there is a good reason for this control: It prevents bodily processes from spinning out of control, which may be deleterious to health and wellbeing.\n\nEven casually, the specificity of enzymes suggests that there will be particular types. In fact, Nature has "engineered" families of enzymes for specific tasks. One of the most beneficial and abundant classes of enzymes is referred to as proteolytic enzymes. Enzymes in this category have the ability to "nibble" at other proteins, and break them down into smaller chains of amino acids. Hence the name, proteolytic enzymes, which literally means "chewing up proteins."\n\nOn the surface, it might appear counterintuitive to degrade proteins in the body. Are proteins not required for optimal cellular function, and do they not afford good health and vibrancy well into the golden years? Indeed, they do! In disease, however, the human body produces proteins that could potentially have injurious effects, and further compromise health if left unattended. It was precisely this goal that Drs. Max Wolf and Helen Benitez set themselves roughly one-half a century ago when they started their quest to find a wholesome, effective and safe alternative for human health and wellbeing. Of course, their objective was to understand how c comes about and whether natural alternatives could be designed that will not wreak havoc on the human body as radiation and chemotherapy do. Despite their scientific astuteness, little did Drs. Wolf and Benitez anticipate that their systemic enzymes will afford man immense health benefits, irrespective of whether or not systemic enzymes "cured" c.\n\nDrs. Wolf and Benitez, along with Dr. Karl Ransberger, a young biomedical researcher from Germany, tested a large number of enzymes from animal and plant sources. The work was slow, and it progressed in fits and starts, since the researchers had to optimize the conditions to isolate and purify the enzymes. Not only that, they had to struggle to maintain the activity of the enzymes, because the enzymes are notorious for being finicky and unstable. That is, if the enzymes are not handled properly under precisely defined condition, they become inactive. After all, the researchers were working in the 1950s, a time when the basic enzyme technology was still in its infancy, and individual scientists had to rely more on their wits than technology to tweak answers from Nature.\n\nOnce Drs. Wolf and Benitez had optimized the conditions necessary to maintain the enzyme activity, they started the next part of their work to combine and evaluate various enzyme formulations in assessing th

I thinkt that it's at least normal that it hurts - if a little or a lot differs from person to person and from situation to situation.\n\nBut for me, the most important thing is, that it has to be the right person you're with and that you are as relaxed as you can be.\n\nI was very afraid, too - but my partner was so nice and grateful for what I was giving him, that even *if* I was in a lot of pain - and it hurt a lot - I was *proud* that I could give it to him and even enjoyed it because I *wanted* to be with him.\n\nSo it hurt - for me, it hurt a lot even though he was very gentle - but the pain didn't really matter to me because what mattered was that we had this special moment of closeness - and that was, what mattered, not the pain, that I knew would go away soon. \n\nAnd what is physical pain when you love someone for the first time!\n\nDon't be too afraid. Just don't hurry things. Wait for the right boy /man and than, take a lot of time. \n\nSex can be wonderful even if you are in pain (!) \n\nWhen it is the right person and when you know that he loves you and that he knows what you are giving to him in this moments.
It was the Geneva Bible. Becuase The Geneva Bible is a critical, yet almost completely forgotten part of the Protestant Reformation. Driven out of England by the persecutions of Bloody Mary, several future leaders of the "\nReformation came to Geneva to create a pure and accurate translation of the Holy Writ. Concerned about the influence that the Catholic Church had on the existing translations of the Bible from the Latin, these men turned to the original Hebrew and Greek texts to produce the Geneva Bible. This made the Geneva Bible the first complete Bible to be translated into English from the original Hebrew and Greek texts.\nThe creation of the Geneva Bible was a substantial undertaking. Its authors spent over two years, working diligently day and night by candlelight, to finish the translation and the commentaries. The entire project was funded by the exiled English congregation in Geneva, making the translation a work supported by the people and not by an authoritarian church or monarch.\nAll the marginal commentaries were finished by 1599, making the 1599 edition of the Geneva Bible the most complete study aide for Biblical scholars and students. This edition does contain the Apocrypha. The Apocrypha’s notes are minimal or absent in other editions. Additional highlights of this edition include Study Bible maps of the Exodus route and Joshua’s distribution of land, a name and Holy bible with Subject index, and Psalms sung by the English congregation in Geneva.\nThe greatest distinction of the Geneva Bible, however, is the extensive collection of marginal notes that it contains. Prominent Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, John Knox, Miles Coverdale, William Whittingham, Theodore Beza, and Anthony Gilby wrote the majority of these notes in order to explain and interpret the scriptures. The notes comprise nearly 300,000 words, or nearly one-third the length of the Bible itself, and they are justifiably considered the most complete source of Protestant religious thought available.\nIt was continually printed from 1560 to 1644 in over 200 different editions. It was the Bible of choice for many of the greatest writers, thinkers, and historical figures of the Reformation era. William Shakespeare’s plays and the writings of John Milton and John Bunyan were clearly influenced by the Geneva Bible. Oliver Cromwell issued a pamphlet containing excerpts from the Geneva Owing to the marginal notes and the superior quality of the translation, the Geneva Bible became the most widely read and influential English Bible of the 16th and 17th centuries. Bible to his troops during the English Civil War. When the Pilgrims set sail on the Mayflower they took with them exclusively the Geneva Bible.\nThe marginal notes of the Geneva Bible enraged the Catholic Church, since the notes deemed the act of confession to men – the Catholic Bishops – as unjustified by Holy Script. Man should confess to God only; man’s private life was man’s private life. The notes also infuriated King James, since they allowed disobedience to tyrannical kings. King James went so far as to make ownership of the Geneva Bible a felony. He then proceeded to make his own version of the Bible, but without the marginal notes that had so disturbed him. Consequently, during King James’s reign, and into the reign of Charles I, the Geneva Bible was gradually replaced by the King James Bible.

There are six other species of swan in the world, but the mute is the only resident one you will see in Britain i.e. it stays in Britain all the year round. During the winter months you may also see the whooper swan and Bewick's swan. Whooper swans visit the north and west of Britain in large numbers, arriving in the late autumn and remaining until the spring, when they fly on up to their breeding grounds in the Arctic. Bewick's swans come in from Siberia and occupy the eastern and southern parts of England. In some areas, both these visiting swans can be seen together. Large numbers gather together in three main groups; on the Derwent Floods in Yorkshire, the Ouse Washes of East Anglia and at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. \n( http://www.yptenc.org.uk/docs/factsheets/animal_facts/swan.html )

The world stops around you when you look into the eyes of the one you love. No one else, nothing else seems important, but the connection that is you share with this person. And you can feel it in thier eyes. As if when they stare back into yours, that they are saying without speaking, "I adore you, respect you, desire you, admire you". True love is when you connect on a level that makes you want to do everything you can to make that person happy, and that they do the same in return. It is a powerful feeling, when the world stops around the two of you. You will know it.\n\nLustful kind of love is much different. Its the feeling that omg I have to have that person, they are so very attractive, and that I think I am in love with them. Its a false true love.
Chances are that if you're cycling that fast you're not bipolar.\n\nOK, so bipolar's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.
I'm not quite keen on small arms but this is what I know between these two guns:\n\nThe AK and the M16 are a product of different philosophies and needs the USA and USSR were going through. The USSR was constantly in combat in 300 meters, and thus needed faster weapons. And because of the fact that it was a large-conscript based Soviet army, they needed guns that were cheap, reliable, and easy to use. The AK is known to work perfectly even under the dirtiest conditions the gun has gone through.\n\nOn the other hand, the US army preferred Lighter weight, accuracy and ergonomics. Thus came the accurate, semi-auto M16.

You need to look up the meaning of "serf." Serfs did not live in towns; they lived in the servant quarters of a mansion or castle, occasionally in a cottage on the lord's lands, and worked the fields for the master of the land. They were a step up from slaves because they usually owned a small plot of land for their own produce, but they had to pay taxes, and had to give priority to the lord's needs.\n\nIf the lord owned a large amount of land, the serfs, including craftsmen like smiths, would live together or in small cottages near each other in a village, even more than one village. They were not towns in the sense we use today. Barter was often used for obtaining goods that were not produced or made at home.\n\nObviously, the villages allowed persons with different skills to live together and satisfy their needs as well as the needs of the lord. As time went on, the serfs were paid in money rather than in just the protection the lord offered, and the lords began to realize that they could make more by taxing or charging the serfs for services. The serfs realized they could act together to oppose things like high fees for grinding wheat or corn, or even set up their own mills on their own land. The feudal system was coming to an end.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serf

I judge how well I serve people by them simply knowing my name, and having a normal conversation with them when they come into my store. I have quite a few regulars, and we are on first name basis' with each other. I assume that if I wasn't doing a good job, they wouldn't keep coming back.

I'd assume you have 4 more months to train, but that should be a good amount of time. Gradually increase you average distance and don't run the same amount everyday obviously. Do a couple of 10 mile days and then on one day run 15. This'll get you used to suddenly running a lot because it'd obviously be torture on your body to run 26 miles everyday. But you could do that once in a while during your training, it'd be a good idea.

it should really depend on your objectives. if you have a good head financially, you would file single and claim 9 or 10. your paychecks will be greater, but it will be up to you to "invest" that money so you can pay your taxes when they are due.\n\nif you file single and claim 1 (yourself), you will probably have a small refund or owe a small amount at the end of the year. this, of course, is provided that you don't have any weird transactions.

you can switch, but it will take a week or two before youll want to get in it so be prepared. Let your baquicil level drop as much as possible, get your ph situated into the "good" range (7.2 - 7.6), then double shock and filter, filter, filter! Make sure you clean your filter frequently, clean and soak if you have a cartridge, chemically clean and backwash if you have sand (you may want to replace the sand but it should't be necessary), and clean and replace media if you have DE. Keeping your ph level "good" will help the change go better, so check it and make any adjustments BEFORE you shock. You will have to do this two, three, or more times before the water will clear up. When you do see the water start to clean up you will want to make sure you get a good algaecide in there too, putting it in before your water clears up will be a waste as you will be loosing water with the filter cleanings.

When you realize that it's more than just having someone to cling too. Or someone to have sex with. You know, when you hurt when they hurt. You are happy when they are happy. They are your partner on a mental, physical, and spiritual level. And you know that you would sacrifice everything you have for them without thinking about it. That's when you know it's love.

Don't place all conservatives as ignorant. But I agree with you that abstinence only is wrong. I think it is the prudish society that doesn't even want to tell their 5 yr old what their body parts are. People should be taught responsibility for their actions. If you engage in sex, this is what can happen. Teach them the consequences for the action, not "don't do it".

An at bat only consists of the time you are at the plate and get a hit or get out. Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting .300, you got on base 3 times via a hit and got out 7 times. Now, your on base percentage does factor in walks and times that you are hit by a pitch. Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting 300 and have 4 walks, then your on base percentage is .500. It is .500 because you went to the plate 14 times and got on base 7 of those times (3 hits and 4 walks) - half of the time you went to the plate you got on base.

Some people may be smarter than others because the may have more synaptic conections capable of reaching more neurons in many more parts of the brain. Having access to more "storage area" for memories, and being able to retreive more information from these areas. The resulting interconnectivity may produce a math genius, a gifted pianist, a soccer player, or a teacher or a physician. The first years in our life, under the care of our parents, our central nervous system is maturing. What happens then, may help explain your question. Loving, supporting parents, the absence of disease, and very good early education will create more synapsis. Some of these characteristics may be of importance for the survival of the species, and will be coded in the DNA. So someone may be born smart, but without love and education early in life, may not be able to achieve its greatest potential.

In some ways, we already have a sort of voucher system for higher education. Think about how Pell Grants work. They are available to the student, to be applied, regardless of where the student attends.\n\nI think the only question is whether states ought to follow the federal model. My view is that it does seem to work fairly well, but I think there are other issues below the surface.\n\nState budgets spend a great deal for higher educational institutions, many of which behave as though they are accountable to no one. This proposed change is a way for states to force universities to be financially accountable. But, if this expense is set aside,\n\nEffectively what you end up with is a nation full of private universities. Private colleges from Harvard to Seton Hall have provided excellent education in this country for years, and there's no reason to think they can't continue. Further, schools that are freed from the onus of state planning often thrive. But some will surely decline, and in those cases, the state governments will be left with the decision of whether to let them die or to bail them out. In the end, these bailouts may end up being more costly than any structure that now exists, so states would need to decide how committed they are to this new approach.\n\nIn the end, I think it may be a wonderful experiment, and I'm anxious to observe while one or two states experiment with it. If it were my state, however, I'd proceed cautiously, as there are many unknowns on the horizon, and I'd rather watch someone else and learn from their mistakes first.
As we say in HR - there is nothing illegal about being an a**hole.\n\nAs long as his verbal abuse is not motivated based on a protected reason (age, sex, race, etc) there is nothing technically "illegal" about it.\n\nThat doesn't make it right. I'd suggest talking to your HR department, if you want to go that route. You're likely to stir up some bru-ha-ha. Document times, dates, and content of the inappropriate interactions he has with you, because you will be asked to articulate your complaint. "My boss is mean to me" isn't going to cut it.\n\nOther than that, about the only thing you can do is look for another job or post to another postion internally. You can quit and try for UI, which under the circumstance you might or might not get. Again, they also usually like to see that you tried to solve the problem with in the company before up and quitting.

Suicide is a great sin in Islam and "suicide bombers" are not in any way real muslims, they are only muslim by name. I don't know where they got the impression that killing themselves would take them to heaven because that is SO untrue. The word "jihad" has nothing to do with holy war. It basicaly means to fight for your rights as a muslim. Example, many muslim women are experiencing difficulty wearing the veil these days, so for a woman to go out wearing the veil anyways in like "jihad." She is strong in her beliefs and is doing something that in no way harms anyone else. I hope this helps.
Well, \n\nConnect a webcam to your PC is easy as 1, 2, 3.\n\nIf you are using Window XP and if your webcam has a USB connection (it should) you just simple plug it in the USB gate, wait a few seconds for your computer recognizes a "new guests".

You need this CD to install your webcam.\n\nIf you you Window 98 or earlier, you do the same thing but you have to go to Control Pannel > Add new hardware > and on the list look for the CD in CD-rom.\n\nGoodluck

Mark 9:1, "And he said to them, "Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power."\n\nJesus meant himself... his death and resurrection... the coming of the Holy Spirit. That is what I gather together. Jesus repeatedly said, "The kingdom of God is near".\n\nIndeed they did not taste death --- the Spirit of Jesus came... with power.\n\nAddition:\nThis does not refer to the actual "second coming" but the coming of the Spirit of God.

Some years ago I taught a class for drop-outs preparing for the G.E.D. If the test is still the same, it is not hard. So long as you can read and comprehend, you shouldn't have any problem. Other than the math section, all of the answers to the questions are contained right within the reading. \n\nWhat ever you do, don't let your fear hold you back from taking the test. I'm sure you can take it again if you have trouble the first time and if you do have trouble, at least you'll find out what you need to work on. They may still have practice tests out there, also. \n\n"JUST DO IT" and let us know how you do. We're all routing for you!

Hydrogen is a red herring. Because it bonds so easily, there's no way to keep a large amount of it. It costs to much energy to take out of water. It also is impossible to indefinatly contain. I think if we wish to move away from geological fuels, we'll have to stick with bio-diesel.

You make a solid case for trading michael Vick. I often wonder if the receivers feel the same way. They have a solid receiving corps and an excellent tight end. Vick was an excellent college quarterback, and he still is. If they could run the option and mix in the pass sporadically he would be the perfect fit. But in the NFL the option is just not an option. (funny?....nah) You are correct about Schaub. He seems to be a nice QB with an accurate arm and good decision making skills. I think Vick is too concerned with proving to everyone that he can pass when most would be satisfied if he can prove that he can win. I think he has the skills to be a good QB but he must work on his accuracy and decisions. I think Atlanta is not the right place for him. They want to run the west coast offense for which Schaub would be an excellent fit. I say trade him. You won't get the full value. Maybe take a second round pick.
Maybe we'll (U.S.A.) get 11 of them who can play soccer! ;>)

You can find out for yourself if they ask you for money in order to represent your daughter. No legit agency would do that. Legit agencies would only take a percentage of your daughter's pay *after* they have gotten her work. They also shouldn't be trusted if they insist that you pay for new headshots by their photographer or any other service. They can recommend that you do those things, but if their representation of your daughter is contingent on you paying them money *before* your daughter gets any work, I wouldn't trust them.\n\nAlso find out what their union affiliations are (SAG, AFTRA, Actor's Equity, etc.) and see if you can find out information about them from those unions. Good luck! If they are legit, it really is a great thing!

That depends entirely on what species of catterpillar and what quantity of caffeine.\n\nCaffeine is a widely occuring substance found in numerous unrelated plants. All of those plants are fed on by different species of catterpillar and the caffeine has no effect at all.\n\nHowever if a caterpillar that doesn't normally feed on caffeine producing plants is exposed to caffeine it could die. Or it could be rendered sterile. Or it cold fail to pupate. Or it could start behaving oddly such as climbing down off the plant and wandering across the ground. The effects vary widely with the species of catterpillar and the dose of caffeine.

I dont believe that our politicians are liars any more than anyone else. They probably live more honestly than most. Anyhow, we live in whats known as a "representative republic". That means our elected officials are chosen by whom best represents the people there, or at least the people that voted. So, if you think all politicians are liars you can do two things: 1. be vocal about the fact that you want someone who is honest and will do what they say they will do (George W. Bush did do that look it up) and 2. you vote. People often get the leadership they deserve.

That's a gigantic question -- these days, "alternative medicine" seems to run the gamut from "anything your insurance doesn't cover" to snake oil & superstition.\n\nThe only risk that holds true for the entire range, I suppose, is that your insurance company probably won't cover it. Some do, though, which has been nice to see.

The origin of billiards will probably never be exactly pinpointed. While it may have sprung from earlier games played with balls on a table in China, Italy, or Spain, the best guess is that it originated in France as an indoor version of a lawn game similar to croquet. (On the other hand, some historians have suggested that croquet originated as an outdoor version of billiards.)\nThe name almost certainly comes from the French billart, the stick that was used, and that word probably comes from bille, meaning "ball." When first recorded, in the 15th century, the object of the game was to push a ball through a croquet-like wicket to hit a peg, similar to the stake in croquet. Players used a club-like stick, which became known as the "mace" in England.\nWhen the ball was up against a rail, however, the head of the mace was too unwieldy and the other, narrower end of the stick was used. This was called the "queue," meaning tail--hence the modern word, cue.\nShakespeare refers to billiards in Antony and Cleopatra--which led one early sports historian to conclude that it was an old Egyptian sport--and by 1675 it was very popular in England. The first known rule book was published that year, and its writer claimed that there were "few Towns of note therein which hath not a publick Billiard-Table."\nThe first steps toward making billiards a "scientific" sport were taken by a Frenchman, known only as Captain Mingaud, who was a political prisoner in Paris during the French Revolution. While in prison, he enjoyed playing billiards so much that he refused to be released when his time was up.\nMingaud discovered that, if he rounded the cue tip with a file, he could aim more accurately. He also added a leather tip to further improve control of the ball. After finally leaving prison, Mingaud traveled around France giving exhibitions and stirring a great deal of interest in the sport.\nThe leather tip lost its effectiveness when it became shiny with use and had to be replaced frequently. An English billiards teacher, Jack Carr, learned that putting chalk on the tip prevented miscues. He was also evidently the first player to hit the ball off-center to apply spin.\nCarr was a genuine hustler. He traveled around Europe during the 1820s, giving his demonstrations and selling his magical "twisting chalk" at an exorbitant price, throwing in a free lesson on how to make it work. As a result, the term "English" entered the lexicon of billiards--although, ironically, it's called "side" in England.\nBy that time, there were several different versions of billiards. In France, the most popular game was carom billiards, played with three balls (occasionally four balls) on a pocketless table. As in modern billiards, the object was to hit both of the object balls with the cue ball--called a carom or a billiard.\nThe most common game in England was also played with three balls, but on a table with six pockets. There were two ways of scoring: By pocketing a ball (other than the cue ball) or by hitting both of the other balls with the cue ball. This game is the ancestor of modern pocket billiards and English snooker..☺
As a young teen, I worked as a missionary in Mexico. I could forever remember the smell of the plaster on the walls of my room, and the smell of the smoke-filled foggy mornings. I remember the children and the dirt and the imprint it made on my soul. It changed me forever and made me so thankful to live in the US and have so much!\n\n30 years later, I returned to the same orphanage. Wonderful to see so much progress... electricity, water, clean and healthy children. I yearned to smell that smoke (which was actually trash fires) mixed with the morning fog...but it didn't happen. The wet plaster smell of the buildings was gone as well. It all came back to me when I started loving on the children...the smell of kids! Like tortillas and dirt! How I love the tight grip of the children pulling me in each direction to come and play! In the distance, the pungent aroma of tripe being cooked, and the sound of barking dogs and roosters crowing. It's like I had been there forever. \n\nI'll be going back again this month. So wonderful to create new memories and build on the old ones!

Because they have small minds and that's all they know to say.
Yes. With just the towers there will still be many who will or will attempt to cross and there will be a lot of shooting and then I believe we(the USA) will be blamed for a lot of carelessness, etc., and the whole thing will blow up in our faces in the global community. Best to go ahead and do it right to start with and put up a fence. The costs? No much considering the costs of those who died on 9/11 and the money we're spending to rebuild Iraq. What about stopping the terror right here at home. It is the least we can do to help show our young people in Iraq we are doing our part here. Janie

Ohhh...I'm doing good. I'm located in a small town called Terra Alta, WV in the Appalachian mountains. Population under 1,500. As for were I live the poker runs and rallies were pretty much over with a month ago due to the cold up here. There will be a polar run in January over in Maryland...but that can be cold especially if temperatures reach the teens or low 20's. Many of the runs they have here goes towards families that have a high medical expense else their property burnt down. They had 2 runs maybe 3 for a little girl in town who was 12 yrs old for a medical condition, however she passed on about 2 months ago. They have had runs for Muscular Dystrophy and the Christian motorcycle ass will have Run for the Son to raise money for missionaries. Over all most runs go to the people around here with outstanding medical expense (if at all possible to help children).
Hmm. I bet a lot of Asian American women are scoffing at the idea of the docile woman who stand one step behind her man.\n\nAsian culture and maybe Latin (not too sure) does place an emphasis on female roles and what they are (more home maker) BUT these are respected and not seen as servitile lesser jobs but as equally important (it is just as important to bring home a paycheck as it is to raise kids that don't rob, cheat, steal, and expect handouts.).\n\nBUT yeah, don't think Asian and Latin women are all begging to cook and clean for you (unless you buy her desperate butt out of a magazine).\n\nAny race can have the woman you want or not.

The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA or EFAA) was enacted in 1987 by the United States Congress for the purpose of standardizing hold periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate institutions' use of deposit holds. It is also referred to as Regulation CC or Reg CC, after the Federal Reserve regulation that implements the act. The law is codified in Title 12, Chapter 40 of the US Code and Title 12, Part 229 of the Code of Federal Regulations[1].
Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \n\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \n\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it will become an oil reservoir. In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir.
I have been in the same situation and personally I would not advise you to go ahead. Its best to just stay friends. I fell in love with a guy who was my colleague, my senior and I really thought he was the one and now he has dumped me after we had decided to start a family and get married. Now I'm left holding a baby and having to worry about finding another job. It's just not worth it because when things do go sour it will be really awkward not for just you but for everybody else that you are working with. Try and find someone outside the office it would make your life a lot less complicated. At the end of the day its your decision, I really hope you make the right one!
They congregate in specific areas, rather than spreading through the nation. California has the most in one place. I have read that up to 50% of the inmates of California prisons are illegal immigrants. (It looked like legitimate census data, and was quoted in governmental literature.)\n\nFurthermore, the poor have it hard enough without downward pressure on their wages.\n\nI'm for closing the border and legalizing qualified illegal immigrants here. However, I want the future expansion of legal immigration through an extended guest worker program to wait until border security measures are in place.

The tilt of the earth's axis (relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun) causes the seasons. If it were tilted more, the seasonal changes would be more pronounced.\n\nIn our winter (in the northern hemispher), when the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, a smaller fraction of the area north of the equator is illuminated by the sun, our days are shorter, and the sun is lower on the horizon. All of these factors result in receiving less of the sun's heat during the winter. (This is also true during the fall, but the winter is colder because the northern hemisphere has already been cooling off during the fall, so by the time winter starts (around December 21), we really start missing the sun's warmth.)\n\nIf the earth were tilted more than 23.5 degrees, then the sun would light an even smaller percentage of the northern hemisphere in the winter, would appear even lower on the horizon, and the days would be even shorter. So winter would be colder and darker.\n\nBut in our summer (and spring), the opposite would occur. The sun would rise higher in the sky, would be up for more hours each day, and would illuminate a larger percentage of the northern hemisphere. In fact, if the earth's axis were tilted 90 degrees to its orbit, then on the day of the summer solstice, every place in the northern hemisphere would have 24 hours of sunlight, and the sun would be directly over the north pole all day. Think what THAT would do for melting the polar icecap. And of course the same thing would happen in the southern hemisphere 6 months later, while the entire northern hemisphere was in the dark for the entire 24 hours.\n\nBottom line: Greater tilt means greater seasonal changes.

McClellan, a rising military star in Ohio, proposed an overall strategy for the war directly to President Abraham Lincoln, one that emphasized the part his army could play. Scott, the general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, wrote a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861, stating in part:\n\nIt is the design of the Government to raise 25,000 additional regular troops, and 60,000 volunteers, for three years. ... We rely greatly on the sure operation of a complete blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports soon to commence. In connection with such blockade, we propose a powerful movement down the Mississippi to the ocean, with a cordon of posts at proper points ... the object being to clear out and keep open this great line of communication in connection with the strict blockade of the seaboard, so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.[1]\n\nScott went on to warn against hot-headed demands for a march on the Confederate capital, Richmond.\n\nScott's plan involved two main parts.\n\nBlockade the coast of the South to prevent the export of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops from the South and to keep them from importing much-needed war supplies. \nDivide the South by controlling the Mississippi River to cut off the southeastern states from the western. Scott considered this an "envelopment" rather than an "invasion", although it would require armies and fleets of river gunboats to accomplish it. \nHis proposal received considerable public criticism at the time. A famous newspaper cartoon depicted a huge snake squeezing the Confederacy, thus giving the plan its popular name. The United States government never formally adopted it, but President Lincoln did implement the two parts. However, he ignored Scott's warning against direct invasion, and used far more troops (nearly two million), trying repeatedly to capture Richmond.\n\nLincoln called for a blockade of the South on April 19, 1861, six days after the fall of Fort Sumter (and a few weeks before Scott's letter). The blockade itself, thought to be an impossible task against 3,000 miles of highly irregular coastline, was an unparalleled success within the first six months, and nearly impregnable within the first two years. The blockade accounted for the vast increase in the price of cotton abroad and the extreme scarcity of manufactured goods in the South by the end of the war, contributing to the South's defeat. It was the most successful naval blockade to date, and the first

It's really a matter of quality, isn't it? When there is little to distinguish between two items, aside from brand name recognition and status, I'm comfortable with the less well-known brand. But if the quality of the merchandise suffers when choosing the generic or no-name brand, I'm compelled to go with the known brand.\n\nDoes this make me brand conscious? I guess it does in part but not entirely. I am certainly not going to feel embarrassed, let alone demeaned, by selecting a product that is just as good as the name brand one. Honestly, who cares? I don't.\n\nThe single most expensive branded item I have? Isn't that just asking what is the single most expensive item I have, period? I mean, everything has a brand name of some kind. Certainly big ticket items like cars have brand names, right? So, by that standard, assuming my car to be the most expensive purchase I've made that has a brand name, wouldn't said car be the most expensive item I own even if it were not a prestige brand? Are you following my logic? \n\nI'm afraid I've no half-baked stories for you but I do think I've otherwise addressed all your questions -- and asked a few of my own, in the bargain. Cheers! ;-)
Blood tests will not show imminent heart attack. High cholesterol readings put one at risk, but not imminently. There are symptoms that can foreshadow a heart attack, however. These are most often bouts of fleeting chest pain or chest pressure associated with some shortness of breath. They can occur with increased frequency and severity over period of weeks to give one a warning. On the other hand, many heart attacks are sudden and without warning. There are stress tests to perform in order to see whether the arteries are blocked and high risk of heart attack exists. Talk to your doctor about these.

Its not easy as you will need to obtain a queen ant before you can start the colony. Making the nest is easy just a perspex box with soil in, make it about 3 inch wide but it needs to be big, they will make there own channels & you can see them in the box living there life.Plus you need a food source. Depends on what type of ants you gets, Ants can be herbivores & Carnivores.So best to try & get leaf cutter ants or something.

[AM / IS / ARE] + [VERB+ing]\n\nUSE 1 Now\nUse the Present Continuous with Continuous Verbs to express the idea that something is happening now, at this very moment. It can also be used to show that something is not happening now.\n\nUSE 2 Longer Actions in Progress Now\nIn English, now can mean "this second," "today," "this month," "this year," "this century" and so on. Sometimes we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second.\n\nUSE 3 Near Future\nSometimes, speakers use the Present Continuous to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future.\n\nUSE 4 Repetition and Irritation with "Always"\nThe Present Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like Simple Present but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."
This is just a couple of paragraphs a copied and pasted from the bottomm links ( this is a fairly long article). They helped me a lot when i was researching about short/long term forex strategies and tips. All the rest of the helpful articles are in the 'forex resources' section on http://www.forextradinghq.com\n\n\nIn order to profit from the forex market, you will need strategies and also the will to change these strategies. Traders who lack a well thought out trading plan are prone to panic and confusion, when unexpected swings in the forex market occur. Many traders will tell you that trade driven by emotion is the fastest way to deplete your funds. Whether or not you are using a technical or fundamental style, it is still essential that you have a proper view of the market.\n\nDeveloping your own trading style is a time consuming process and is often acquired through trail and error. It is unfortunate that there is no ‘golden’ rule’ to trade in the forex market and technical and fundamental styles of trade won’t be successful all the time. Successful traders often have a unique style of trading and take up various strategies during a trading session. Only continuous practice will help you gain a feel for the movements of the forex market.

Vladimir Semeonovich Visotskiy ( 1938-1980 )\n\nVladimir Visotsk Without doubt, the most famous Russian bard was born in Moscow in 1938.\n\n Visotsky graduated from the school of acting at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1960. From 1964 he worked at the Moscow Theater of Drama and Comedy on Taganka. He wrote his first song in 1960 and would ultimately have a significant influence on an entire genre of music.\n\n His gruff voice and starkly, sometimes slyly, poetic lyrics have inspired two generations of Russians and are working their way into the young hearts of a third. The end of his life was also occupied by his second wife, Marina Vladi, a popular French actress of Russian descent. He died in 1980 from a heart attack, the death knell of a creative life lived too fast. The Soviet government, always aiming to please, erected a monument to him in Moscow, apparently contrary to his wishes. Whether the government did it well or clumsily, the point was made by an entire society as it mourned the death of their Shakespeare-with-a-guitar.\n \nDuring his study in the Nemerovich-Danchenko acting school-studio at MHAT Visotsky wrote just a few songs. His main passion were short stories featuring Seryozha - employee of the Central Boiler House, Vasyochek (Visotsky's nickname) and others. However as many other students Vladimir sang quite often, mainly "street songs" and thief's cant that he learned in the Lev Kocharyan company on Big Karetny.

The market is 'risk efficient': investment vehicles with the highest reward also have the highest risk.\n\nAs an example, ETFs of emerging stock markets have performed best in the last 2 years, but they are extremely risky and volatile (check the market action in the last few weeks).\n\nOne way to reduce risk while maintaining performance is to diversify: by holding ETFs covering different asset classes (such as US, foreign, small-cap etc...), the risk of your total portfolio will be less than the risk of its components taken separately.

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \n\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \n\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \n\n \nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. "I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron," she wrote later in her autobiography. \n\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \n\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, "My Day." \n\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: "...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...." \n\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: "the story is over." Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.

In a naval reserve unit or Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corp or Summer Training Camp, a Gunnery Officer is responsible of the parade, morning and sunset procedures, protocal and in general discipline abord the unit. The Gunners in the unit can be identified by the chain they wear...it looks like the Boatswain's chain but is a little larger. Also, they have a gunner's call, which resemble the old English Police Whistle. This tradition dates back to the Royal Navy and has been carried on to the RCSC. Originally also, Gunnery Officers would wear black leather gaiters, this tradition was flopped by the CF upon unification in the 60's.
the military can be a decent life. Honestly. I joined at 18 and I regret having gotten out after only 8 years. But it is not for everybody.\nWith the demmies in power you can almost count on the following:\nNo cost of living increases for service members, in keeping with the national COL.\nInadequate training due to lack of proper funding.\ninadequate equpment. No new weapons systems or upgrades available.\nLittle benefit increases over the next ten years.\nLittle schooling available due to cut backs.\nlarge numbers of soldiers being denied re-enlistment.\nPoor living conditions in the US for soldiers living on base due to inadequate maintenance funding.\n\nThat's what makes soldiers so great. they put up with this crap and still do the job they are trained to do better than any other soldier in the world.

There are plenty of ways for men to be stylish, but it sounds to me like what you are really asking is why doesn't society approve of men adopting women's styles when women have adopted many men's styles. I don't know the answer to that. We readily accept a women in pants, but we ridicule a man in a dress. We encourage young girls to push the boundaries and not be defined by traditional female roles, yet we offer no similar encouragement to young boys. Perhaps it is because women have long been regarded as second class citizens (even though they are not) and many see women adopting men's styles and roles as some sort of perverse evolution. The same people would probably view a man wanting to adopt more feminine styles and roles as some sort of backslider. I don't know if this helps or it was the answer you were looking for, but I don't expect the situation is going to change anytime soon. You'll either have to learn to live with it or flaunt convention. Good Luck to you!!

You're right, the death penalty is not a deterrant. It is a purely moral issue and an understandable one. It's not wrong to think people who do horrible things shouldn't get to live out their days, even if it is in prison and I doubt many death penalty abolitionists would be protesting to save Hitler from execution. However, the problem is in the application. Some people who do the most horrible things don't get the death penalty, and some who do things that don't rise to the level of horrible do.\n\nI say leave it up to the victim's family. If the criminal is eligible for the death penalty, let the family decide and let them pull the switch because they are the ones that will have to live with the pain the rest of their lives.\n\nAlso, it is just as expensive to society for someone who is sentenced to death because the State pays for the appeals process, which is automatic and lasts for many years.
My daughter gets the same problem here and there but it does go away. Another thing to look into is liver and pancreas damage that does cause a rash but that also goes on your feet very itchy. Good Luck
It is important for a few reasons. \n\nThermal Expansion--temperature changes cause the metal to expand and contract.--Without the joint the concrete would crack.\n\nBuilding settlement. With a parking garage, there is a lot of weight coming on and off during the day and night. It is a much heavier building when it is full of cars. This causes a sponge effect with the ground. The joint acts as a sort of shock absorber.

I always figure a road is a major thoroughway - the surface that most cars take when getting from A to B if they're a fair distance apart. \n\nA street, on the other hand, tends to be more secluded. Except in smaller towns, you may only go down a given street if your destination is directly on it or right near it.

The best thing to do would be to enter him into pageants. Where I live at (Fayetteville, Arkansas) pageants are held at surrounding malls in different cities. Baby pageants here are for boys and girls. They always have several winners and they usally get put on the covers of baby magazines and get scholarships. Also if you contact Baby Talk magazine they are always looking for baby models. If you can't find Baby Talk magazine, they always have them at pediatricians and OB/GYN offices. Good luck!!

Nicolaus Copernicus (February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer who provided the first modern formulation of a heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of the solar system in his epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). Copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of Toruń (Thorn), in Royal Prussia, an autonomous province of the Kingdom of Poland. He was educated in Poland and Italy, and spent most of his working life in Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, where he died in 1543.

Talk to the doctor, get the pills and take them. \n\nAsk if he would prescribe pills so you won't have your period for longer than the normal 28 days. Standard bc pills make your body think it is pregnant so the menses are suspended. At some point the pills turn into placebos, or they run out and your body goes back to having the period. So, you have to ask the doctor if you can do it. He will give you pills that won't go to placebo or won't run out before your next desired period.
Serve God by doing what Jesus would do. Is masterbation a sin, if it involves lust then yes. Jesus said whoever looks at a women to lust after her has commited adultery with her in his heart. Obviously every man struggles with it. But its better to mess up and confess you are wrong, then say nothing wrong with it. Of course you need to overcome it, because it is an addiction and the body will never become satisfied. Just remember we will face God one day. So its best you do what you conscience tells you.
depends on the situation, but more than likely yes

Okay, this best friend of his is extremely out of line, not to mention hes immature. Don't take him or his actions personally. However, if "the best friends" actions are making your boyfriend act differently to you, then you need to be having this conversation with your boyfriend-Right Away.\nIf your boyfriend is influenced by his best friends immaturity, something is indeed wrong. I would second guess your relationship with Him.\nHowever, give you boyfriend the chance to explain why he is acting out like this. Then you decide what is best for you to do!

I think that whatever happens in the host's house should be the host's responsibility, but whatever happens after the guests leave the host's driveway, is the sole responsibility of the persons involved- not the host of the house they just left. If everything becomes the host's responsibility, then a whole new can of worms will be opened and then to what extent, how much, when, and what happened has to be defined and it becomes too complicated for anyone to resolve whose responsibility it is. When it comes to drinking, the same applies for in house rules (especially under-age drinking) but after the guests leave, drunk or sober, it is their responsibility. EXAMPLE: If I leave a bar or restaurant and I had a few drinks and drive home drunk and crash into another car, is the bartender/waiter responsible for what happened because I drank at their place? No. People need to learn to become more responsible for their actions. Too many loop-holes and laws are being made that allow for people to do as they please b/c it is not their fault. Accountablity is a major factor the success of any society.

Function Overloading: This means having 2 or more functions in the same locality with same names but different NUMBER or TYPES of parameters.\n\nEX:\nvoid SetAString(const char* val) {m_someString = val;}\nvoid SetAString(const std::string& val) {m_someString = val;}\netc..\nthe functions are distiguinished based on the parameters.\n\nFunction Overriding: Two functions are said to be overidden when they share the same name and/or even the same parameters(Number and Type) but are part of diff classes, one of which is inhereted from other.\n\nEx:\nclass B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, "HELLO", NULL, MB_OK);}\n\n}\n\n\nclass A : public class B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, "NO", NULL, MB_OK);}\n}\n\nthe result of calling SaySomething depends on the subtype of\nthe object\n\nIn short: Overloading is a method that allows defining multiple member functions with the same name but different signatures. The compiler will pick the correct function based on the signature. Overriding is a method that allows the derived class to redefine the behavior of member functions which the derived class inherits from a base class. The signatures of both base class member function and derived class member function are the same; however, the implementation and, therefore, the behavior will differ.

Put it this way, I asked my husband before we got there, if he believed in ghosts. He said "I believe in exterrestials before ghosts!" He didn't say that the next morning! He said "There were too many things happening you can't explain." I don't know how close you are to st. louis, but it's worth the trip. Go to www.lempmansion.com

I guess. because we are always thinking, we are always aware of everything and nothing at the same time, always wanting to make things better, and that makes living in a world of mediocrity an ongoing hell. most of the time Im thinking 2 or 3 things at the same time, its like watching 3 tvs at the same time different channels, so it gets complicated when someone else is talking to me sometimes coz im too distracted. Always aware, always my head saying things, it never shuts up, even when I sleep, I get lucid dreams at least 4 times a week, during that time im aware of been sleeping, my brain wont shut down and I wake up happy for been flying in my dreams but mad about controling them with my awareness, and I just need a rest of my brain but dont know how. This has isolated me from alot of people that get frustrated when they talk to me and I dont pay attention or I am but also thinking of 2 other things its hard. its hard to focuse, it takes me a long time to start reading because I just have to much in my mind, I need a brake!! from my head... I speak my mind and that gets my in trouble too.

Two nostrils coincide with the two hemispheres of the brain. Studies have shown that by breathing through one nostril (holding the other one closed) can actually make one side more dominate for short periods at a time. \n\nJust remember that the nostrils effect the opposite brain hemisphere. So, closing your "left" nostril and breathing through your right will give your left-hemisphere (logical) dominance and visa-versa for the creative right-hemisphere.
Oh my... well there is hope for you to not be shy. People laugh at me when I tell them I used to be shy. I would literally start puking in school if I thought I would have to do or talk in front of someone. One day I was on a school bus and some kids were picking on a boy that was a bit slow... (older and popular boys) and I decided I had to stand up for this boy. I did and I let them have it and to my knowledge they never picked on that boy again but what happened is after I did that I was like WOW that wasn't so hard or bad and I slowly started gaining confidence. I have actually done public speaking now. Chaired committees and even served as a Jury foreman. I just decided life was to short to be afraid any longer and I made a decision to just go for all I could. I want you to know in certain circumstances I still sometimes feel the tendency to be shy but I just keep going and then I have a great time. I have great faith that you can do this also. Just take one day at a time.\nSo sorry that your 3rd grade teacher was so arghhhhhh!!! Don't give up on others or yourself because of her. Dust yourself off and go for all you want!!! Ill keep you in my prayers xoxox Lori
Christians believe because they are uninformed and encouraged NOT to explore or question their faith. Jesus was believed to have said not to doubt him, or you will go to hell. It seems as though Christianity does not sell well with the educated, but back then no one else could read and write but the few who passed on the teachings of the early Church from generation to generation. Simplistically, most people who believe in God do so because of the many instabilities in their life and the necessity to latch on to something, even if mythical, that comforts them. Too bad they can't find that trust within themselves, instead of a conflicting cartoon character in the sky.

So anyway, this is a reply to a person that was playing that race card...\n\n\nThe angry black thing doesn’t work for me Belinda. \n\nMy mother’s boss, Head of personel for NIH was a black woman. She died a couple of years ago of breast cancer. My parents (who are in their late 70's still keep track, and visit her husband). My boss is black. I think the world of the guy. The manager of the help desk where I work, and I work for a mult-billion dollar a year company, is a black woman. She has 25 employees. \n\nSo you want to talk entertainment? And no “Superfly” crap. The father on “Fresh prince of Belaire”, a judge. Aldus Huxley. James Earl Jones. Oprah, remember her? \n\nBlack Americans are moving into positions of power. Mayors, Congress, Supreme Court, Generals, Admirals. \n\nAnd no, I am not discounting the drug problem, crime rate, and prison population. I hear you on those. \n\nBut, Belinda, you don’t want me, whitebread boy, to solve those for you. That makes me either the liberal or conservative solution you were talking about. \n\nThe best I can personally do, is come up and greet you, look you in the eye, and shake your hand, or hug you, and not really care about the color of your skin. All I can do is accept you as an equal, and I do. \n\nThe rest, well, up to you folks to figure out the answers it would seem. You sure do not want whitebread doing it. We have screwed up enough already.

It's a nice movie aimed for girls between the ages of 8 and 14. The actresses acted very well, even JoJo, who had the chance to experience her first ever acting role in a movie!
Wrong category. This is the hockey category.
I was in the exact same boat..my mother's parents both passed away and she became extremely harsh and obviously didn't want to be a mother anymore, either. If you feel that you would like to volunteer, why don't you try doing it one day a week. There is no limit to how many hours or days you volunteer, considering you are not getting paid. You could even volunteer maybe Sunday's for 3 or 4 hours. If you want to be a librarian, then volunteering at a library would look excellent on your resume. Why don't you also try getting a job at a local bookstore? Barnes and Noble are always hiring. That also would look good on a resume. You should definitely try to get a paying job on top of volunteering as to become more independent and 'get out of your mother's hair' so to speak. Becoming more independent will get you further on your own and you won't get in to fights as much...
I love that movie, it's great!

Easy: the distance in both directions is exactly the same = 225 miles. Recall, also, that distance = speed * time.\n\nAssume the plane's speed is x, wind speed is y, and that both remain constant in both directions:\n\nWith the wind, d = (x + y) * time\nAgainst the wind, d = (x-y) * time\n\nso (x + y) * 2 hours = (x - y) * 3¾ hours\n\n2x + 2y = 225 miles\n\n3¾x - 3¾y = 225 miles\n\nNow, you need to multiply each equation by a factor so that the y's have the same multiplier, thus:\n\n15x + 15y = 1687.5 miles\n15x - 15y = 900 miles\n\nNow, add the two equations together, thus eliminating the Y value:\n\n30x = 2587.5 miles, and thus the plane's speed, x = 86.25 miles/hour\n\nNow, substitute the value for x back into one of the equations to solve for y:\n\n(2 * 86.25 mph) + 2y = 225\n\n172.5 + 2y = 225\n\n2y = 52.5 miles/hour\n\ny = 26.25 miles per hour

Here are some tips:\n\nA. Reduce your current bills:\n1) Eliminate immediately anything that is not needed. (i.e. Cable TV, cell phone, a subscription, etc.)\n\n2) Phone bill - switch to a internet based phone. I used to pay about $100 per month. I switched to vonage and now only pay $27 flat fee.\n\n3) Call up your gas and electric company and ask for advice on how you can reduce your bills. They will give you some good advice. It saved me about $200 per month during the winter.\n\nB. Credit Cards\nGet rid of all the credits except for only one. Credits cards can get you into trouble fast.\n\nIf you have many, then you should look pay the most to the credit card that has the least balance. All others you should pay the minimum. Once it is paid, repeat the same with the remaining cards.\n\nThis also works for any other debts you may have.\n\nC. Spend Less\n1) Use coupons when you go food shopping. Buy healthy and natural food for the family.\n\n2) Don't buy anything for yourself personally for a while (i.e. clothes, toys, etc.) until your situation is under control - unless of course you absolutely need to.\n\nD. Saving Money\n1) If you can, have your employer automatically deposit part of your paycheck into a different bank account. This way you won't see the amount in your checking account. This is a great way to save money.\n\nE. Stay on top of your finance - stay disciplined\nPay your bills on time and balance your checkbook often. A great way to do this, is to use online banking. There is a bill pay service you should sign up for with www.paytrust.com. All your bills become viewable online and you can setup up automatic payment schedules. This will ensure all your bills get paid on time.\n\nF. Donate money\nI know this sounds crazy when you are trying to save money, but trust me. If you lend God money we will give you manifold more. Do it as often as you can and whatever amount. Even if it is $1.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nps. Pray to God for help. He will answer.

Cowboys are specifiacally AMERICAN!!!! What country do you think of when you see a cowboy???? Russia?\n\nNot even SOUTH AMERICA or NEW ZEALAND comes to mind. You automatically think Midwest to fully west. Cowboys carved out a whole area of the United States and are our heros and villians of yesteryear. They are one of our mythologies...like the 1920's mafia or 1930's bank robber.
I think you should talk to you parents about this and they may consult a doctor. If you are not smoking, not over weight, you may be asthmatic.

The point is that the mass shown on the periodic table for each element is in fact an average that takes into account the most abundant isotope (the one actually shown in the table) along with other less abundant isotopes (typically radioactive ones) that most often differ in one neutron or two. \n\nFor example, Hidrogen´s atomic mass should be just 1. But it is slightly higher than that. That´s because H1 is only the major form of Hydrogen. There are also H2 (deuterium) and H3 (Tritium). And the atomic mass averages the mass of all of these (1,2 and 3 respectively) according to their abundances. \nHere are their abundances:\n\nH1 (Common Hydrogen)= 99.985%\nH2 (Deuterium)= 0.015%\nH3 (Tritium)= minimal traces\n\nThus for a weighed average you need to calculate:\n\n1*0.99985+2*0.00015+3*0= 1.00015 which is a bit higher than just 1.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of the elements. \n\nExcelent question!

In the Episcopal church, they have a retirement plan that they contribute to, just like a corporate manager. They negotiate the details of this plan during the process in which a parish search committee hires a priest. In other respects they are like any employee, paying ss and disability taxes with the rest of us, and drawing social sec. upon retirement.\n\nI believe that Catholics have a centrally administered retirement system, since (I think) priests are assigned by the diocese.\n\nJust a wild guess, but I think the other protestant demonimations follow the same kind of strategy as the Episcopals. \n\nChurch of England (Anglican) I have no idea. At one time the priest was a government employee, of sorts. Now, I don't know.

If you continue to have bleeding, then there may be some tissue that didn't get expelled from the uterus. As long as the bleeding is scant, you can probably just wait and see if the bleeding stops on it's own. If the bleeding continues, the only thing to do at that point would be a D&C.

She's sending you mixed messages, either deliberately or accidentally.\n\nShe may not realize that telling you she misses you a bit sounds to you like an invitation to get back together. She really shouldn't be telling you this, even if that's how she feels.\n\nTelling you explicitly "stay away" is bigger than "occasionally I have passing thoughts about you.". So stay away.

Yahoo Answers may replace or*al sex with ***'s in this answer, but I hope it will help you.\n\n________________\n\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - What Does the Bible Say?\nCouples often ask, "Is oral sex a sin?" The best place to look for answers is in the Bible. Hebrews 13:4 says, "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." The first point the Bible makes very clear is that sex - all types - is designed specifically for married couples. Non-married couples are not to practice premarital sex. \n\nThe Bible never indicates exactly what a husband and wife are allowed to do in their sexual relationship. However, there are some sexual principles that we can consider. \n\n\n\nMutual Consent - 1 Corinthians 7:5 says, "Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control." This verse indicates that each sexual activity should be mutually agreed upon. \n\n\nAdultery is Sin - The Bible is very clear that any form of adultery is sin, even if both people in a marriage relationship agree to it. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 says, "It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God." Adultery also includes "swapping" or adding sexual partners. \n\nViewing Pornography is a Sin - Matthew 5:28 is very clear. "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Pornography viewed alone or together as a couple is sin. 1 John 2:16 says, "For everything in the world - the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does - comes not from the Father but from the world."\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Practical Application\nWhen answering the question "Is oral sex a sin," it is important to remember that God created sex to be a beautiful expression of love for married couples. When the husband or the wife does not feel that sex is a "beautiful expression of love," then changes need to be made in that couple's sex life. Evidentially, the actions are not mutually beneficial to each person. Nothing in the Bible says that oral sex is a sin, however it may not be appropriate for every couple. \n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Questions to Consider\nConsider these questions when answering the question "Is oral sex a sin?"\n\nIs oral sex voluntary and have both the husband and wife agreed to it?\n\n\nWhy do you want oral sex? Is it for pure sexual pleasure or is it to fulfill a sexual fantasy derived from porn?\n\n\nHave you or your spouse been convicted by the Holy Spirit that oral sex is wrong?\n\n\nDoes oral sex edify and fulfill both you and your spouse?\nWhile answering these questions, pray for guidance from God. He will reveal the answer to you - for your relationship.

First of all I am a legal citizen here in the US, but I support this cause because I feel it is very noble. \n\nSome people don't support this cause because they have never seen their children begging for food around the table and you don't have a penny to feed them. Why do you think they dare to cross the scorching dessert to come into this country? Some people don't support it because they have not seen their children die of hunger or a disease that can easily be cured because of lack of money!!\n\nYes they work out on the fields picking fruit all day long, raining, snowing, out in the blazing sun for less than minimun pay, or clean urinals, wash the dishes at the restaurants. I understand as someone here on yahoo answers said, that the children have to start somewhere and that they would be doing these types of jobs because they have to start somewhere. Maybe the person is right, but would you like you children to perform these kinds of jobs? I know I would not like my daughter to do this. \n\nNow have you ever wondered why is it that the price of the veggies out in the stores are cheap? Yes, it is because these people come into the US to do these jobs for very little money. If the US starts paying what they are supposed to pay (minimum wage) prices will sure go up. Many people don't understand this because they live off of welfare. \n\nUndocumented Immigrants do not qualify for welfare because of their status in this country. Some people may say that their children do qualify if born here in the US. Yes, they do, but don't forget they are US citizens. Now a days it is not easy to come and have children here in the US if you are not a legal resident. Here where I live, pregnant women that don't have proof of legal residency have to pay all doctor visits adding up to $3000.00 the least. \n\nI am not for the undocumented people who come here and harm others. But the ones who come here to look for a better life for their families, I support. Don't you think that if all they wanted to do is harm, they would cross the river through the night and rob the people near it? Why do they walk miles to cross check points and get norther? Yes, they risk themselves to bring food to their family's table. \n\nI work, go to college and am a mom, and feel very disappointed at those people who live off of welfare, but lets not forget that all US citizens can qualify for it depending on their income, not only the children of these people.\n\nAnd please understant that it is not onlye the HISPANICS who come here illegally. It is everybody around the world who has seen poverty to the lowest of its levels. One thing some people here in the US will never get to see.
The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, respectively, in the sense that the length of time elapsed between sunrise and sunset on this day is a maximum for the year. Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.
The mountain was given its English name by Andrew Waugh, the British surveyor-general of India. With both Nepal and Tibet closed to foreign travel, he wrote:\n\n…I was taught by my respected chief and predecessor, Colonel Sir Geo. Everest to assign to every geographical object its true local or native appellation. … But here is a mountain, most probably the highest in the world, without any local name that we can discover, whose native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal.… In the meantime the privilege as well as the duty devolves on me to assign…a name whereby it may be known among citizens and geographers and become a household word among civilized nations.\n\nHence Waugh chose to name the mountain after George Everest, first using the spelling Mont Everest, and then Mount Everest.

Liniment, from the Latin linere, to anoint, is a medicated topical preparation for application to the skin. Liniments are of a similar viscosity to lotions (being significantly less viscous than an ointment or cream) but unlike a lotion a liniment is applied with friction, that is a liniment is always rubbed in.\n\nLiniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscles or from arthritis. These liniments typically are formulated from alcohol.\n\nNow Horse liniment is Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). While DMSO has a low toxicity, prolonged exposure can cause dermatitis and possibly damage the liver or kidneys.\n\nIt is commonly used as a liniment for horses, although its use in humans is controversial.
With the works of modern medicine, it would be hard to conceive that there hasn't been new and different techniques for the disorder. For these types of questions I always recommend a search engine such as GOOGLE or ask.com. You may also want to try webmd.com.

Let Q = the number of quarters Quincy has. They are worth 25Q cents.\n\nDirk has (Q+5) dimes worth 10(Q+5) cents = 10Q + 50 cents\n\nWhen Natalie gives Dirk a nickel he now has 10Q + 55 cents, but he then gives a dime to Quincy leaving Dirk with 10Q + 45 cents and Quincy with 25Q + 10 cents.\n\nFinally Quincy gives away a quarter leaving him with 25Q - 15 cents, which equals Dirk's money or 10Q + 45\n\n25Q - 15 = 10Q + 45\n\nSubtract 10Q from both sides: 15Q - 15 = 45\n\nYou can finish from here I am sure.
The memorized Islamic response to all of this seems to be one of 2.\n\n1. The Crusades, The Crusades, what about The Crusades - You mean The Crusades that ended 800 years ago. You're justifying modern violence because of something that ended 800 years ago? In any event, The Crusades were the Christian's response to Musim conquest and violence...end of story...try to focus on, say, the last 7 centuries.\n\n2. Well, every religion has some elements of violence, Islam is no different...ok...name 5 acts of violence that have been committed in the name of Christianity in the last 10 years...you might need some extra time.... Ok, now name 50 acts of violence that have been committed in the name of Islam in the last 10 months...you can even exclude Iraq and Afghanistan...pretty easy, huh.\n\nMuhammad was a warrior and a military leader right up until his death. Name one other religion whose founder had a background even remotely similar....you can't? There's your answer.

Before you jump on the medicine cabinet bandwagon, be aware that there are often many side effects to these prescriptions. While it may clear up your anxiety, you may have other issues! Of coarse, only a licenced medical professional can determine if you're a candidate for anxiety medication and what the best path for treatment is for you. My recommendations before you start popping pills are:\n\n1: Can you pin-point if there is a specific incident or occurance that is giving you anxiety? If you notice you're only having episodes at work, maybe it's time for a job change. \n2: Keep a journal of your feelings and incidents of anxiety. This may release some of your stress, and additionally help a doctor understand you're situation.\n3: Try yoga, pilates, or other relaxing workouts. Not only will it get you in shape, it will help your body produce more "feel good" chemicals in your head which can help with your anxiety.\n4: Look at your diet. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and copious amounts of water help more than you think in making all parts of your body feel better.\n5: Do away with negative habits. Smoking, drinking, and drugs can all negatively impact your brain's chemistry and cause undue stress and anxiety.\n6: Seek a Higher Power. Even if you're not particularly religious, you could benefit by praying. Think of it as free counseling. You talk, He listens. \n\nHope you feel better!

I believe, and i may be a little optomistic, that Australia will make the 2nd round (maybe with a draw against Croatia). Don't get me wrong, Croatia is very good, but their team isn't as good as previous world cup campaigns.\n\nIn the 2nd round, they will play Italy (Czech Republic will top group E) and they will lose for the simple fact that Italy, while not performing well in the past few tournaments by their standards, will have a technical and tactics supremecy. I think Totti, Italy's play-maker, will destroy Australia.\n\nThe reason why Australia will be a better team then they were before is:\n1. The Australian Governing Body, Football Australia, is much more professional and well organised then before.\n2. They are now going to be part of the Asian qualifying groups, which is, in my opinion, easier to get out of the their present system, meaning regular competition and regular World Cup's, which means constant improvement.\n\nHope this answer helps and wasn't too long-winded.
C. Symbiosis involves a relationship by which both partners give something to the relationship. A pathogen only takes, but does not provide. \n\nFor A, the human intestine provides food, and the bacteria produce vitamins. For B, the bacteria aid in pollination and once again are provided with a food source. For D, bacteria once again have a food source (and even outcompete) and thus help provide protection. And E, the bacteria fix nitrogen for the plants' survival and get a place to live and food.\n\n\nThe key to convergent evolution is that the two species are not closely related, eliminating B and D. The process involves the independent acquiring of similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. This points us to E.
Bodies are pretty resilient. That said, I'm sure it's NOT good for someone to work non-stop without a break.\n\nYoung people are hired for 'brain' work as you put it because they are fresh out of school and on the cutting edge of technology. Older people (SOME not all) prefer not to learn new things and are then relegated to accepting what positions they can to make a living.\n\nJust my opinion.
My best friend Francis had it done and she is thrilled to death with it! But also on the other hand you have to realize that it is major change to your body. My friend Francis told me that somehow it changed her physiologically inside and the things she used to love she now hates. Weird huh? Well any type of surgery is an invasion of the body in ways we never dreamed of. This is why I have such amazement at how many people are so readily available for plastic surgery. People don't realize how much you are altering your body permanently each time you go under the knife, and i don't mean vanity wise either. There are many things going on inside that most people ignore. I would love to see someone do a study on this thesis alone. Ill be it would be amazing at the the results. Anyway, I'm sure you will be very happy with the results but just be "aware" of the changes you are going to go through. Francis had no regrets. Good Luck.

Well, I believe in every country there will always be rude and discourteous people. On the flip side, there will also be polite and well-mannered people. Let's not compare why certain people are nicer than others. Let's face it, the human race ain't perfect at all. And each and everyone of us has our own set of perceptions and thinking with regards to other peoples. \n\nAnd remember, the survey is just a figure which can always change with time. \n\nBut on personal account, perhaps the reason why Singaporeans emerged 30th probably stems from the individualistic personality and due to lack of social cohesion. The 'culture' that puts one before the society perhaps may cause the lack of graciousness among some members of the society. It all boils down to the individual's family upbringing and environment, to a large extent. Hence, there are differing factors that might lead to the lack of courteousy among some Singaporeans.
Neurofibromatosis(Von Recklinhausen disease)(NF)\n\n\nWhat is NF? You ask. Neurofibromatosis, pronounced Neuro-fi-bro-ma-to-sis, (NF for short), is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States, (one in every 3,000 to 4,000 births), even though not many people are familiar with it. There are two genetically distinct forms of NF, NF-1 and NF-2. The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. \n\nThere is no known cure for either form of NF, even though the gene for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment other than the surgical removal of tumors which may some times grow back. \nNF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, meaning you can not catch it from other people. Only 50% of those affected with NF have a prior family history of NF. If an individual does not have NF he/she can not pass it on to his/her children. NF is classified as a disease. Disease is so negative. NF is not contagious.

The Internal Revenue Service is a Branch of the Government ... part of the Treasury Department. It's employees are referred to as Civil Servants and their pay grades are GS## (such as GS7, GS13, etc.) ... the GS stands for General Service ... they do not hold military rank, but are employees of the Federal Government. The IRS is funded by the Treasury Department (a cabinet-level arm of the Executive Branch).\n\nThe IRS is about as government as you can get outside of the Supreme Court, Congress and the Military.\n\nUPDATE: At the expense of a couple of points here (who really cares anyway) ... I happened to think ... "Maybe she's referring to the Federal Reserve?"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is NOT part of the US Government. Look at a dollar bill or any US paper currency ... they are "Federal Reserve Notes" ... \n\nThe Federal Reserve is actually privately owned ... Banks, to meet their Federally mandated laws regarding reserve requirements, must hold a certain amount (based on the bank's assets) of Federal Reserve stock ... The Federal Reserve (the root of the US Banking Industry) is wholely and completely a private organization ... obviously endorsed by the government, but technically, it's privately owned.\n\nThe details and history of this are far to complicated to mention here ... I'd be happy to discuss it with you through other means (IM, email, etc.), and it's surprisingly interesting to most folks.
wait do you mean 5'4? I could not image you even being alive at 110 at 6'4. But I am assuming you are 5'4 and it is a pretty realistic goal to make. Do whatever exercises you want, anything that you enjoy, hiking, running, tennis, swimming, biking, ect. You should always do at least twice as much cardio than weight lifting. I would suugest doing pilates and maybe yoga to get toned, and also try weight lifting a little. And cardio depending on what you do could be betweeen 2-5 hours a day at least I woud think. Like tennis I do 3-4 hours a day. But running I would only do about 1/2 hour or an hour, but you would have to do more than just running. If you do not want to bulk up do pilates and yoga instead of weight lifting, and just weight lift your arms a little. Running might bulk you up So try tennis or walking, hiking, I dont know I would not worry too much about bulking up, if you are burinig fat at the same time they wont get bigger, they will just get more muscular and less jiggly. Eating habits, dont change them all at once, try eating more fruits and veggies as a snack instead of chips and cookies, and for meals eat whole grains and protein.

Such a ban would probably not happen in the United States. The first amendment would prevent it. Some lawmaker might try it and it might even get passed into law somewhere in the US, but the courts would slap it down pretty quickly. Law should not dictate how a religion can be observed.\n\nNow, if you are referring to federal, state, or local government being prohibited from having religious displays, then that is already banned by the constitution. The government should have no part in promoting or banning any religion. Even if 99% of the US were the same religion, the government should stay out of the religion business.
Hon, I have been there several times and I know it hurts. Time is the best healer. First try to get your mind on something else, anything so that your mind isn't on the person. Go to the movie place and browse for a good movie (a comedy is always good), go to the library, or out shopping and browsing. Just get out and do something...anything to avoid sitting at home and thinking about the person. Have a good cry, listen to sad love songs and then get out of the house and do some things. Try spending extra time with friends or your kids(if you have them), or even at work. You will find as each day goes by the pain fades. You may still love the person, but when you think of them again it won't hurt anymore as time goes by.

skyman,\n\nthis is kind of a big question since there are very very many different kinds of lasers that work very differently. i'll try to answer it in a general way.\n\nLASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. i'll get to exactly what that means in a minute.\n\nthe earliest laser was a rod of ruby crystal, with mirrors on both ends with the shiny faces pointing towards the crystal, and some very bright flashbulbs around the sides. one of the mirrors was a perfect mirror - 100% of the light was reflected - and the other was not quite - 99% or so was reflected but about 1% passed through.\n\nthe way it worked was that you'd fire the flashbulbs, which would shine very brightly into the ruby crystal. all the atoms in the ruby absorb some energy from the light and their electrons go to a higher-energy state - this is called a "population inversion" and is important to the operation of a laser.\n\nanyway, before long some of those atoms will start emitting photons and settling back down into their ground state. some photons will be going the right direction so that they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the rod, over and over. \n\nevery time a photon goes past an excited atom, it causes the atom to radiate a photon too, in the same direction and in phase with the original photon. this is the "stimulated emission" in LASER. before long this cascades into a torrent of photons, all bouncing back and forth between the mirrors - about 1% of them leak out and you get a laser beam.\n\nthere are a lot of other designs for lasers, but they all work on the same fundamental principle. you have some kind of material that can emit photons when it's in an excited state, and you put it between two mirrors in what is called an optical resonator or optical cavity. of course there are a lot more technical details that i'm skipping over, but hopefully you get the basic idea.

actually on this one i would have to agree somewhat with you. In FB the schools are complaining that if the ordinances that they passed go into effect many parents will leave and take their children with them.They argued that they get a percentage of money from the federal government depending on how many students they have in their school district and get extra money for all the classes they have that are ESL.personally I didn't know that was true but I guess that explains a whole lot why a lot of schools are so determined to have more kids in theirs school district and why many of them have a lot of ESL classes.all about the money.

A pure democracy is where every person gets a say in how every part of the government is run. Like for instance everyone would come together in a town to vote and decide on what would be best for everybody. It's quite idealistic and can be prone to abuse in this way:\n\nIn a democracy, the ones who are largest and loudest have the most power. Therefore a whole people could be wiped out if the majority said "everyone with brown hair must die." Also as times goes on, the democracy deteriorates into a dictatorship as the most power pursuing persons gain more and more power over the others. A classic example is the deterioration from Lenin's Communism to Stalin's dictatorship later on. It's the closest thing to a pure democracy that has existed as of late.\n\nAs for a Democratic Republic well that's what we have. It's democratic because we vote for whose in office. It's a Republic because it has the legislative, judicial, and executive branch.

I don't know how extensive your research should be, but i can tell you the principle of how this works. the name protease already give you a lot of hint, protease is biological enzyme that catalyse the hydrolysis of proteins, the protein comes from the food we eat, say like your white shirt got splattered with some sauce with some meat extract, this stains will be difficult to remove, by degrading the protein within the stains will make the stain easier to be removed. how does protease catalyse hydrolsis of protein? \n\nfor example a serine protease in our clotting activating factors, such enzyem uses its hydroxyl group of its serine residue (the residue of serine amino acid contains a hydroxyl group,) with the lone pair of electron on the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group, it can make neucleophilic attack on the peptide bond carbon atom, as a result the peptide bond is broken, and as you know proteins are made of chains of amino acid connected by peptide bond, thus hydrolysis occurs, i can't give you any more detail of how this mechanism works because i am feeling spleepy right now, good luck any way zzzzzzzzzzzzz
I would have to go with Neal Peart...he's easily the best there is BUT I'm hardly a fan of Rush....the drummer in my band just thinks he's the greatest and I tend to agree!! He's got a hell of a drum set!!!
maybe go and visit them. Or get your mind on something else.I know how you feel though...I miss my librarian too.She didn't yell @ me when I lost my books...

Think of it like this. I wouldn't call it so much culturally insensitive as it is stupid, because if they were culturally insensitive, they would make fun of you because your race. Saying things slow, they are more DUMB because they see the race that you are and they automatically think they need to speak slow. That has nothing to do with cultural insensitivity, that has to do with the amount of intelligence a person has. I used to live in Texas. Trust me, some people, depending on where your living, are quite slow and dumb, so I wouldn't think much about that particular thing.

Our wrongdoings after we confess our sins to Him. In the Bible it says that once we confess our sins to Him and are truly sorry, he forgets our sins. Unfortuantly, we still remember them and sometimes have a hard time letting go and sometimes other people remember our mistakes too.
That depends on how you look at it and whether or not you believe it was over slavery.\n\nIf it was over slavery, which is the opinion of some, then the south started it because they did not want to give up there "Right" to own slaves.\n\nHowever, there is another opinion that may ring more true. That is that the war actually started over the North wanting the south to give up it's seperate nation attitude and join the Union. When they refused the North's request the North decided to force it. So if that's the case then it was the North.
i think those may help

Nope, the free programs that are out there only allow you to convert small, and I mean small, sized PowerPoints. In all actuallity, a 16 minute presentation is actually a bit large for a flash file, and most likely wouldn't be worth the time it takes to convert, much less the money.

Start by reducing the amount you eat by 10%. This way, you'll be taking in fewer calories, but your body won't go into shock and start hoarding everything you eat. Lower it another 10% every couple of weeks. Don't go lower than 1200 calories unless you're under DIRECT supervision by a doctor!! \n\nYou're not going to get instant results, but they'll be lasting ones.
i know. i hate labels and people who label and people who label them. i like punk and hardcore rock, but i'm not either of them. punk is a description of SOUND not people anymore. i only listen to bands that don't label.

Pilates is fantastic. You don't have to use weights and it tones your whole body. There's plenty of classes and great home DVDs available. Just check out amazon.com. Of course, if you don't burn off the fat tissue with some form of cardio your arms won't really look any different; kind of like all those people who do hundreds of crunches but still have a fat belly. Their abs are great, but hidden under all the fat.

The subject of an artist is the person or thing that poses for the drawing. Mona Lisa was "the subject" of Da Vinci's masterpiece. The "subject of a forensic artist" could be the following (and I'm sure there are more):\nA missing person where a picture of when they were young existed and the artist had to draw them as they would look today (age them)...\nA missing person who authorities believe may have changed their appearance...\nA dead person whose idenity is unknown so they need to get it out to the media, etc.,\nOr a crime scene.

If you were to reduce your calorie intake by 100 calories a day you could lose weight. For example you swap a coke a day with water. There are various reasons why people lose weight. Some include sickness, stress, worms even. Some explained and others can't be. If you aren't sleeping enough that can also assist with weight loss. So the answer is yes, a person can lose weight without even trying.
Hello! I hope this helps...\n\nIndigenous musical styles\n\n*Southern styles\nAmong the various groups of the island of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, a highly sophisticated musical repotoire called kulintang exists in which the main instruments used are bossed gongs not dissimilar to gongs used in Indonesia.\n\nAmong the Tausug of the Sulu Archipelago, The Sindil (sung verbal jousts) is a musical lighthearted style that is sung by a duo of both sexes sung in front of an audience. Teasing, jokes, and innuendos flow into the verses, the better ones being applauded by the audience. The gabbang xylophone and biyula traditional violin are the instuments mainly used. Although Sindil is a particular genre of music, the verbal jousting musical type is also found in many other parts of the country, especially among the Visayan peoples, who are ethnically related to the Tausug. Sindil are normally used at weddings and other festive events.\nOther musical traditions of this region are those of the serenade form Kapanirong and the outdoor "loud" music repotoire called Tagonggo.\n\n*Northern styles\nAmong the indigenous peoples of the Central Cordilleras of the northern island of Luzon, music is also played with gongs, but unlike those of southern repoitoires, these gongs, called Gangsa, are unbossed and have their origins in mainland Asia. Music is usually played to accompany dance, and because of this is mostly percussion based. gong ensembled are normally accompanied by drums. The music is polyphonic, and uses highly interlocking repeated patterns.\n\nSPANISH INFLUENCE\n\n*Harana\nThe Harana first gained popularity in the early part of the Spanish Period. It's influence comes from folk Music of Spain and the Mariachi sounds of Mexico. It is a traditional form of courtship music in which a man woos a woman by singing underneath her window at night. It is widely practiced in many parts of the Philippines with a set of protocols, a code of conduct, and a specific style of music. Harana itself uses mainly Hispanic protocols in music, although its origins lie in the old pre-colonial Philippine musical styles which still practised around the country (See Also Kapanirong style of the Maguindanao of Mindanao). The main instument used for Harana is the Guitar, played by the courter, although other string instruments such as the Ukelele and less frequiently, the Violin and Trumpets are also used.\n\n*Kundiman\nThe Kundiman is a lyrical song made popular in the Philippines in the early 19th century, but having origins in older pre-colonial indigenous styles. Composed in the Western idiom, the song is characterized by a minor key at the beginning and shifts to a major key in the second half. Its lyrics depict a romantic love, usually portraying the forlorn pleadings of a lover willing to sacrifice everything on behalf of his beloved. In many others, it is a plaintive call of the rejected lover or the broken-hearted. In others, it is a story of unrequited love. Almost all traditional Filipino love songs in this genre are heavy with poetic emotion.

I am also from India but I was raised in America. My dad, being a professor of engineering, tells people to watch TV programs like CNN and other News channels, read books, read the newspaper, and read other things. Also mingle with other people.\n\nP.S. Which part of India are you from? And what state are you in now?
Oh OWIE! That sounds awful! \n\nIf it's been two days, and you've seen no improvement, you probably need to have it looked at.\n\nI've suffered multiple knee injuries & surgries, and my doc always tells me to alternate ice and heat every 15-20 minutes for an hour, then take a break. (Say an hour or so...) Also, you need to be taking an anti inflammatory, such as Ibuprofin (Advil).\n\nI hope you feel better!
Now now now ....No need to make a list of what she's got and doesn't and what she should not have or what she shouldn't be on.\n1) Her computer might have been a gift, or she got it dirt cheap, or her credit is good enough to finance a great PC for pennies a month.\n2) She has to be under a certain income bracket for section 8 to accept her, otherwise she wouldn't have it.She's got three children and sometimes even a working married couple may not be able to afford it all.\n3) It's not a sin to have children, and who is anyone to tell anyone to have their tubes tied, You never know, maybe one of her children might be the future President of the USA and change everything for the better.\n\n4) I have a $12,000 wedding set and if I ever went on welfare, They cannot deny me or make me sell it, simply because of the value of the rings.\n\n5)Her internet connection? C'mon, I have super fast DSL and all I pay is $14 per month.Internet isn't expensive.\n\nNow my opinion on the matter;\nHow awful that this happened to you\n\nFirstly. I feel very sorry for you.If they were just the managers, why couldn't you speak to the owner before the eviction was final?\nAlso, you could have spoken up in court and let the judge know about the situation that got you there in the first place?\nI know it's too little and too late, but what you can do is let this neighbors apartment manager know what she did to you. And you can take this neighbor to court. Show the judge her police records of theft and show the judge the debt she caused you to have with the bank etc. You can take her to small claims court and possibly recover what she stole and damages as well (like costs for looking for a new apartment+ security first and last month, utility deposits etc.\nYou can also sue the management that evicted you as well, for allowing this neighbor with her priors on the premises, which caused all of this.\n\nFind the strength to look for a place to live. Look towards apartment agencies which will look for a place for you even the section 8 office should have a list.\n\nLearn by your mistakes, never expect a debt, or even a bill to supercede your rent responsibilty.Because your gas can get cut off, your electric, your internet..and you will still have a roof over your head. Don't allow anything to come before your rent, at least you shouldn't do that.Renting is a buisiness, and managers/landlords got property mortgage and bills to pay themselves.\nYour bank should have forgiven all the loses when they were notified,all you had to do was tell them which debits you didn't authorize.\n\nTake what you will from my advice and good luck to you.
It sounds like it will be starting very soon, and you shouldn't go by whether you are getting cramps or not. Some women don't get them around/during their periods ever, while some do. Your best bet would be talking to your mom about getting you some panty liners, so when you start, you don't leak and get an embarassing stain. I'm sure she'll be glad to help you out.
After years of reading and asking similar questions, I have come to the conclusion that people can fairly easily compartmentalize their belief systems. They can rationally understand that Santa, the Bunny, and the Fairy are all myths, but they can continue to go on happily believing in their god.\n\nThese people can be intelligent (or not) in many other areas of their lives and rational (or not) on most subjects, but they cannot make the leap to realize that their god fits in the exact same category as the myths listed above.\n\nFamily and culture do a great bit of reinforcing the myths for these folks and in so many cases there are severe "penalties" for even doubting the truth of the myths. Many people never get past that.\n\nThe myth reinforcement stops at one age or another for Santa and the others, but the reinforcement continues for people who believe in one or another invisible sky fairies.

No one should be treated as disrespectfully as that ... With a TEXT msg? Saying he was now single?. He sounds colossally immature and doesn't know what he wants or what he had with you. The way you are feeling now will subside and new and more exciting things will come to you. If he loves you, he will find you and be all that he should be and more, but he is not going to do it while you sit there and wait on him, allowing him to treat you like a part time pal/gf. Move on, make your own decisions and stop letting someone like that control your heart, head and choices!! This too shall pass my dear! :) \nGood luck and thinking of you!

I am not familiar with the immigration law you are referring to, but I do know that it is a manuever of the business elite in developed countries around the world to hire immigrants, legal or illegal, because they can pay them lower wages and thereby increase their profits. That's why the United States has an immigration problem. Businesses want them here, and the government looks out for the interests of the business elite above all else. As an American of French origin, I can tell you that I resent the French business elite being allowed to exploit the cheap labor of immigrants. I see it as an attack on the French people's standard of living as well as an attack on French culture itself, since these immigrants, mostlly from Arab countries, are so different culturally .

Depending on the school, you may just need to take one math class (usually called something like Math for Lib Ed majors). It encompasses the basics of several different types of math. However, depending on how far you want to go in Psychology, they may also have you take a Statistics class. In fact, if you can, I would advise taking the Statistics class over the Lib Ed Math class - the Statistics class could provide you with some useful information that you may actually use later in life, but it's generally thought of as being a little harder. Most people I know, though, struggle with advanced math because they see the problem and think "how on earth is doing this problem going to help me later in life?" It's hard to work up the motivation to learn something if you can't see the point in learning it, right? Well, while you may not ever use the Pythagoream Theorem again after Lib Ed Math, many of the concepts in Statistcs can be applied to situations you run into every day. Good luck!

That's a good question: This from the Orlando Sentinal-\n\nOn Sunday, the Australian government issued the following alert to its citizens: "We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in the United Arab Emirates because of the high threat of terrorist attack. We continue to receive reports that terrorists are planning attacks against Western interests in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Commercial and public areas frequented by foreigners are possible terrorist targets." \nLINK\nhttp://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/orl-thomas21_106feb21,0,2383510.story\n\nI am thinking yes. \nThe money used to fund the 9/11 attacks, most of it, \nwas sent to the hijackers through the UAE banking system. The UAE stonewalled U.S. efforts to track \nal Qaeda bank accounts after 9/11. In addition, the Emirates does not recognize Israel. And the UAE was a \ntransfer point for shipments of nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. And if those aren't good \nenough reasons, I would just suggest I'm at a complete loss to offer what might be considered good reasons." \n -- Lou Dobbs, CNN
It is the Coriolis effect. When fluids move at a large scale in a rotating frame of reference, they deflect. The deflection is always to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Air always flows away from high pressure and towards lower pressure. If the air is moving away in all directions and deflecting to the right (Northern Hemisphere), it rotates clockwise. If the air is moving away in all directions and deflecting to the left (Southern Hemisphere), it rotates counterclockwise. The Coriolis effect applies only to large scales, like storm systems. It does not affect the direction that tubs, sinks, or toilets drain.
Sounds like your grandmother is a very old-fashioned. O.K. so that's not it at all. She is probably upset because your not the innocent little girl you used to be. I can say this... You must reach her no matter what it takes. Tell her that you love her but, if she had knocked, this would not be an issue, that it breaks your heart that she won't even talk to you about it. This could cause her to worry, or stew, herself into a heart attack or a stroke. So do what ever it takes. I'm feeling grandma's pain....I am one too.

From an employers prospective, I think it would be cost they are looking at. They have to pay a temp to do your job or have someone take on your job that works there for the time that you are away. Production for the time would be low and a money loss, either by paying a new temp or the guy who has to do your job and his. Employers are not threatened by you taking the time, in fact, a lot of employers know there are life issues that need to be delt with.
I say yes. Because they all find different stuff. But it's not worth paying for. Also no one program is gonna find everything.

It's caused by a bacteria getting into the urethra and making it's way up he urinary tract. It's cause by many things including not cleaning properly.

The question is why doesn't your family like her, is it justified. Sometimes we refuse to see things others can because we are blinded by love. I am not a cold person, I am a romantic at heart and I believe that love conquers all but in the same aspect protect YOUR heart in the process by talking with your family about their reasons. And remember they will always be your family, and if their reasons are bogus then marry her because true love is hard to find.

There are lots of possibilities, depending on your son's interests, and what you consider a "decent" price range. A small dobsonian telescope is a good starter scope at a reasonable price (~$250 - $800). Meade Lightbridge dobs are built a bit better than the entry level ones and disassemble for better portability (~$500 - $1000).\n\nFor a more high-tech, computer controlled scope, the Meade LXD75 series (~$900 - $1400) is a good place to look. Various Schmidt-Cassegrains from Meade and Celestron ($1000 - $5000 & up) are another possibility. Astromart is a good place for used scopes, as it's used mostly by serious amateurs. Avoid eBay unless you really know what you're looking for - a lot of junk there. \n\nThe links below are a few places to browse, plus the Yahoo telescopes group where you can find some informed opinions about astronomical equipment.

hey distinguished professor of economics....i think you forgot the tax guy that the 10th guy would be able to hire to find enough loop holes so that he wouldn't have to pay anything. Your theory looks good on paper, but it doesn't come anywhere close to reality. In real life the guys in the middle are paying the lions share, while the poorest and richest are paying virtually nothing. The only fair tax plan would be a % of gross wages across the board, including incentives, bonuses and stock options.\n\nI'm not sure Communism would be so bad, but i'm sure if it ever came about, we'd be wishing for capitalism and democracy again!

It's a disk for an LS-120 drive. Imation produced them, but they've been out of production for about four years now. There were both IDE and USB versions of the drive. They were also developing a 240MB version that never panned out.\n\nYou may be able to find one on the Internet, or maybe EBay.\n\nNeat technology (the drive had two heads - one for floppies, one for LS-120 cartridges), but behind the curve so they never sold well.

trance normally runs anywhere from 135bpm, up to around 155ish, but ideally, good trance normally runs in the 140bpm mark.\n\n8beat sections. 4 by 4. \ntrance normally has a 'mellow' section, where the overall tune is dropped to a mellow sound, either vocal or instrumental.(vocal normallly works best in my opinion. female vocals seem to work better than male, its softer)\ndownload and listen to a few trance songs, and you will pic k up patterns, commong things between them. \nbut the biggest thing is difference. notice, every trance song, has a different style to it. be unique, add your own touch. there is no 'rule book' so to speak. trance is one of the longest running genres, because, its so varied and can adapt easily to latest styles. many styles of trance. hard trance, progressive trance, euro trance....\n\ni never really got into the composing side of things. i played with it, using cubase but, primarily, just DJ'd, so i couldnt tell you the techniques, just what it sounds like

Contrary to popular belief, salt does not react with ice to make water. Instead, since salt can be soluble in water, it lowers the freezing point to about 0 degrees Farenheit. So as long as it is above 0 degrees outside, salt water won't freeze on the roads.

Actually, I feel certain that the tradition started in Sunnyside.\n\nSunnyside is a neighborhood very near the university where the rents are relatively cheap, and you get what you pay for.\n\nBefore they built the new stadium, the old stadium was right where the Business & Economics building is now, which is right next to Sunnyside. Most of the bars and partying happened in Sunnyside as well. Using zoning laws, they drove the bars out of Sunnyside, but it's still probably overall the cheapest place to live in Mo-Town.\n\nIf I were guessing, I'd imagine that the tradition started when a houseful of partying students in Sunnyside pretty much ruined their couch, maybe left it out on the porch for a while until it got really nasty, and were looking for something to burn to celebrate a major WVU victory.\n\nAll hypothetical, but it seems logical to me.\n\n-- WVU College of Engineering Class of 1995

only one i would get is the russian, shear pin is forged instead of stamped (chinease). freind found out the hard way. he took it to firing range fired a box thru it but he didnt know that on the last round the shear pin broke, he was in his bedroom and loaded a full thirty-round clip in it, pulled back the bolt to load the first round in the chamber. justr as soon as the bolt slammed the first round it went off (without him touching trigger) full-auto and emptied the whole banana clip thru his wall into neighbors living room!!!!! as for accuracy, well lets just say, 100 just isnt a challenge. i was plinking things on the bullet stop behind the targets which were at least 250 yrds away and never has to raise the sights off lowest setting. ask any veitnam vet about the sks....they fear it. one vet told me you could take any given rifle in the woods, fire it, then fire an sks, and he could pick it out. they were simply out-gunned. m-16 was a .223...a mere high powered .22. sks is a (7.62x39) very close to a .30 caliber with more bullet mass and range. very formidable assault rifle. and the sks wasnt designed for fully automatic, it was a semi-auto feild infantry rifle, the full auto that shoots the same cartridge (7.62x39) is the ak-47, which is made by several diffrent countries; afganastan, turkey, china,and russia. its been about 8 years since i had mine but i was buying boxes of 20 at army surplus stores of imported russian non-corrosive hollow points for around 4.50 cents a box. and they are hunting legal.

Because there is a HUGE double standard in this world. Unfortunately, it is the woman that has to carry the baby and usually is the one with the custody if the pregnancy was unplanned and the boyfriend ditched her. It is a shame and I feel sorry for any woman in that situation and curse the bastard that left her! Society looks at the woman as loose and the man as virile, which makes no sense to me as they both are doing wrong by the child.

Are you sure you have two drives or do you have one drive with two partitions?\nIf you can't put programs or files on the D drive, then it's probably locked (read only). This most likely means it is a backup partition and should not be messed with, anyway.\nThe best solution would be to use the control panel's add/remove programs utility first. Go down the list and uninstall all the programs that you don't use, don't need, or don't want. If you don't recognize a program, don't uninstall it. Next, clean your system. If you're running Windows (most likely), then use the built-in disk cleaner by going to Start - Run - and typing "cleanmgr" (without quotes) and hit ENTER. Select drive C and clean everything from it, possibly including the option that says "compress old files". This takes a while and actually slows your performance slightly, but will be worth it if you need the extra space.\n\nNow that you've uninstalled some crap, you should have room on the drive. Download a small utility called CCleaner from here:\n\nhttp://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/\n\nOn the right, in the green menu, click "Download Latest Version"\n\nOnce it's installed, find it and run it. In the "Cleaner" section, select everything under the Windows and Applications tabs. If you rarely clean your system, it will clear up a significant amount of space that the built-in windows cleaner wouldn't. Under the Issues section, select everything under Registry Integrity and File Integrity. This will remove many invalid entries in your registry and is safe to use without messing anything up - unlike other registry cleaners. If you uninstalled a lot of programs, then there will probably be a lot of left over registry entries here. This doesn't really free up space, but will make your computer more stable and fast - might as well do it while you're in the program.\n\nAlso, in control panel, open Internet Options - General tab - click "Delete Cookies" - Okay then click "Delete Files" - select "Delete all offline content" and click OKAY. This will clear up most of the stuff saved to your computer from the internet, which can free up a significant amount of space if you've surfed the internet alot and never cleaned out these files.\n\nThere are a lot of other utilities that can be used. The other ones I have I either paid for or downloaded illegally, so I won't even bring them up. Hopefully by now you have some room left on the drive.\n\nAs for the automatic update in Itunes, if this still doesn't work, look at the settings. I don't use it, personally.\n\nHope this was helpful and not too boring. Good luck.

You make two separate lists, one of the pros and one of the cons\nIf you find you have more "cons" than "pros" you are thinking negatively, don't really want to go to college anyway and prefer to remain as thick as two short planks.

STD is an abbreviation used in several different contexts that stand for different terms. It most commonly means :\n* Sexually Transmitted Disease (also, Sexually Transmissible Disease) \nAlso:\n* Doctor of Sacred Theology\n* Salinity Temperature Depth \n* São Tomé and Príncipe dobra, the ISO 4217 code for the currency of São Tomé and Príncipe \n* Short Term Disability \n* Software Test Documentation\n* State transition diagram \n* Subscriber trunk dialling \n* Subscriber toll dialling \n...Which one of these abbreviations do you want the opposite(s) for ?!
The use of "da" is for "deka" or "deca" meaning ten (10), so 1 daNm = 10 Nm. It was very common to use daN in engineering works as a daN is very close to a kg of force (in earth at least). 1 daNm = 0.980665 kgm. Just remember that this kg are force or weight, not mass.

ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors. However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take "call" (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work). They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields. (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field). They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\n\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians. ER docs often do well in their medical school class. But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\n\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice. Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away). This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\n\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business. ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money.

Con: chewing gum in class is disturbing due to those who cannot chew it quietly. I personally can`t stand to hear smacking and cracking of someone chewing gum. It will create distraction in others causing the inability to study and take a test.\nPro: chewing gum quietly can lessen stress and actually burn calories, and if you chew sugarless gum, will clean the teeth.\nThe analysis: Gum chewing should not be allowed in school as there are far more reasons against than for.

I think you came to the right place for advice. Your friends gave you advice that will only get you in trouble. Thank them for their opinions, but try doing this instead:\n\n1. I'd sit down alone and write out some possible reasons my friend said that. Then I'd ask myself, "Is this a normal way to behave for someone my age?" I would be honest with myself. (my guess is that you are completely normal)\n\n2. Then, I'd stop and think about the day when my Mom would no longer be alive...(my mother is very ill right now, dying of a disease) And, I'd realize then:\n\n"My friends can just shove it! I love my mother and she loves me. I'm normal. Things will change when and if I want them to."\n\nThen, if that girl teases you again, just ignore her and be glad you have a good mother.

Is a leasing agent just the person who finds the tenants? If so you probably need a property management company so that they can keep an eye on it as well as handling maintenance and calls as they arise. You will have to probably pay between 7%-10% of the gross rent plus 50%-100% to find a tenant, but then you wont have to try and manage it long distance. \n\nUnless you have friends in the area willing to drop by and do inspections while handling maintenance (replacing the furnace filters is usually a good reason 2-4 times a year) then you will likely need help of this sort.\n\nIf you are already using a management company and just want to fill it with a leasing agent then you may be better able to find the tenant you want. A leasing agent will not mind waiting for the right person while the management company would tend to have an incentive to take the first person to come along. (The good ones will avoid the temptation but it is still there because of how they get paid.)\n\nAnother possibility might be to find someone willing to do a lease w/option to buy so they are responsible for the maintenance and will take better care of it. It might not fit with your plans for the house though.

It depends what you consider difficult.. \n\nbutterfly yea.. you'll get tired pretty quick, those underwater streamlines after the turns kill and its hard to keep your stroke going\n\nbreastroke for me is the hardest, it might not be as tiring but man.. It takes for ever to get to the other side.. and holding your breath after the turn for those long pullouts, it gets to you\n\nback.. hard to stay in line, hard to time turns, hard to stay down underwater facing up with water wanting to come in your nose\n\nfree.. easy? try doing it for 1500m.. keeping your stroke going is the hard part of free, sure its probably the easiest but if you want to go fast, it takes a loooooot of time and practice\n\nIn my opinion, fly is the hardest, but to be good in a stroke is hard for all
According to some 12 hours of tapes of meetings between Saddam, his son's and Cabinent back in 1995. Saddam says that he has told the U.S. that any attack to the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction would not come from a country, but in fact from a terrorist group. These tapes also reveal his son's speaking of moving WMD's so that the U.N. Inspectors would not have access to them. Tareq Aziz the Vice President of Iraq stated that with one batch of chemicals in a water supply could effect 100,000 people then why would a country go to war when this could be accomplished with a small group of terrorist's.\n\nGoing to a wider scope of things if these countries that are so against the Western Culture can figure out that using terrorists to do battle with us makes more sense than actually declaring war on us themselves, thereby leaving us not knowing exactly where to turn to fight back. Is it no wonder that these governments have been manipulating us to battle the way that we have been doing it so far. Did Saddam have WMD's, yes we know he did, he used them on his own people, we know that for a fact. The public now also knows that the Clinton White House was warned of an impending terrorist attack on U.S. Soil as far as 6 years in advance in 1995. We also know that he was moving WMD's that he said he did not have around the country to avoid the inspectors as far back as 1995 or 4 years after he was no longer supposed to have them. We also know that he continued to trade for arms and other war supplies during the U.N. Sanctions by the evidence that we found in the early part of the 2003 Iraq war. Is all of this intellegence faulty, fabracated, or fact? In 2001 Bill Clinton said that his administration would have been better able to handle the attacks of 9/11 than the new Bush administration, and why not? He had 6 years notice to prepare for it, was this knowledge even passed to the new administration, some say yes, others say no, and others still are not sure. I believe that it was passed on and just as Clinton had nothing really to go on neither did Bush until it happened. Could we have been more prepared? Yes, should we have been more prepared? Well from this side of it, it certainly looks that way. This is one time that we need to have actually learned from history, these terrorist's are telling us exactly what they want to do, and they are pulling us in a direction where we are going to hit it straight on like two freight trains coming at each other on the same track. After the accounts that I have read I certainly believe that Saddam warned us that we were a target and I believe that we should be listening to those who are speaking to us now because they are telling us the same truths today as they were 10 or so years ago. Let us not be manipulated into the next phase of this war, let us lead ourselves down the path we must take.

well in my opinion i think that u should just wait to see what happens.. i think that if she turned you down twice that might be a sign that she just wants to remain friends. i dont think that u can do anything to really change her mind, because if she does she will do it on her own without any help. But if u stay close to her and become even better friends i think that it will help change her mind.. hope this helped :)

Although 'the shaved head' was originally applied for good hygiene, it progressed to being executed as a means of 'humility of the military individual.'\nIt also strips the individual of his individuality and allows everyone to be on par, or on an equal level with each other. As the basic-training uniform is also standard and applied to all recruits, allowing everyone the identical or uniformed look, so likewise is the shaved head. \n\nIn concluding: It is for personal hygiene, uniformity, and this promotes team work, unity and Esprit de Corps.
At first I had the "Jesus theory" about the song too. I thought he meant that Jesus left the glory of heaven "The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind" so he could come to lay down his life. And he's going to come back but they're asking why he left us all behind. But then I realized they probably werent talking about that. I think they meant that this man wants to die so his beauty can be preserved. But then again.....I don't know, I have my own personal meaning of the song.
Always talk positive about yourself- even when they ask you "What do you feel is your biggest weakness as a worker?" Questions like these are designed to trip you up. They're looking to see that you have a positive image of yourself. Turn a potential weakness and make it sound good. I use something like "My determination to get things right... " as a weakness. Also they might ask you what you disliked (and liked) about your last job. Turn a dislike into something positive, never ever talk negative about an employer, even if you hated the job. This site helped me, hope it can help you out too :] Good luck!!
First, here’s the average measures:\nErect Length \nMODEST = 14 cm.(5.4")\nAVERAGE= 16 cm. (6.3")\nErect Circumference\nMODEST = 11,5 cm. (4.5")\nAVERAGE= 12,5 cm. (5.0")\nWhile sex even is possible with shorter penis.\nOn some (anonymous) web sites, you find miraculous pills, herbs or creams, which are of no effect.\nAs external methods, there is the pump and the Andro-penis.\nThe pump is practically useless because its effect doesn’t last long !\nThe Andro-penis by external device, with the time and sacrifice gives really a development and maybe a flabbier penis too, and since it’s a new method, nobody still know the possible collateral effects in the time. Somebody affirms that the same result could be possible with some constant and manual exercises. At last, there is the (risk) surgery operation, which isn’t suitable for anybody. \nSince I guess you’re not in the actual condition to resort to such technique, just enjoy your body as it’s. \nGood and satisfactory sex isn’t measured by penis length!
Ice cubes do not float on all liquids. For example, if you place your \nice cube in a cup of light oil (thin cooking oil. Don't use heavy greasy \noils), it will sink. It depends upon density of oils, density of oil is less than water in other words oil is less denser than water thats why it floats on water. If you put ice in more denser oil like heavy greace oil, ice cubes will float on this greace oil.\n\nWhy do things float on water? This has to do with something known as \nbouyancy. It's because of bouyancy that ships can float on water, \nas can corks and other things. It's also the reason that Archimedes ran \nout of his bath naked screaming 'Eureka!' all those years ago. \n\nThink about a tub of water or a swimming pool. If you push your hand in, \nthe deeper you go, the harder the water pushes on your hand, because the \ndeeper you go, the more water there is above you that's weighing down on \nyou. Same with air. If you climb high into the mountains, there is less \nair over your head, so it doesn't push on you quite as hard any more. This \nis the reason your ears pop when you go very high very fast. The \npressure of air in your ears is different from that of the air \noutside, and it is released in a 'pop'.\n\nIce cubes float on water because it is less dense than water. \nDensity measures how much mass there is per volume. For example, if you \nhave a metal cube and a plastic cube of the same volume (same length, \nwidth, and height -- same size), the metal cube is denser than the plastic \ncube. Most people would say 'the metal cube is heavier', and that's \nbecause it's more dense, so there's more matter per unit of volume than \nthe plastic cube.\n\nWhen an object, like an ice cube, is placed in water, the water pushes \nagainst the object, this is called 'exerting a pressure on the object'. \nhis pressure can come from below as well as from above. If you're not \nusing water, and use honey or some other liquid that is denser than water, \nthe pressure will be higher. If you use oil or some liquid that is less \ndense than water, the pressure will be less. The object itself has a \nweight, and is being pulled downwards by gravity. The more mass the object \nhas, the more strongly it is pulled downwards by gravity. If the downward \npull of gravity is greater than the upwards push of the liquid against the \nobject, then the object will sink. If the gravitational pull is less than \nthe upwards push of the liquid, then the object will float. If the two \nforces are the same, then the object will just hang there, neither \nfloating nor sinking.\n\nTbe ice cube floats not only because of its density, but because of its \nshape too. Imagine a huge ship. It's made of lots of heavy metal and \nsteel, but it still can float. This is because of its shape. It is made to \nspread out wide over the water, so that there is more water that can push \nup from below to balance out the weight of the ship. If the ship were just \na solid cube of metal, then it will sink, because the force of the water \npushing from below, the bouyant force, is not enough to balance out the \nweight of the ship, and it sinks.\n\nI hope this explanation helps, and if you have any more queries, feel free \nto ask us Have a great time!

A lunar cycle:\n\nThis explanation can be a bit confusing, so have patience. The moon takes 27 1/3 days to orbit the earth once, but the number of days between one full moon and the next full moon is 29 1/2 days. Why are these two "months" not the same? The answer has to do with the Earth and moon relationship to the sun. If you chart the moon's position every night for a full month, you could compare its position with a bright star, and then wait to see how long it takes for the moon to come back to its position relative to that star. The answer would be about 27 1/3 days. But during this time, the earth has moved nearly 1/12 of the way in its orbit around the sun. So to get from one full moon to the next would take about two days longer, 29 1/2 days, because the moon would have to travel a little further around the earth to get to "full" again.

If you work for her then what you make is legally hers unless you have a contract stating otherwise. Remember you're not making the idea as yourself, but as an employee. \n\nIt sounds like you want her to take the risk, but then you profit if it works. I'm sorry but I don't think that's right. If you came up with an idea and tried it out on your own and not at someone elses bakery I'd feel that you should profit from it. \n\nBottom line is if you're not the one willing to take the risk then you shouldn't be the one to profit. Unless she's willing to allow you to keep your products then I'd find another way to produce them. Open your own business and find bakeries willing to be sold "use" rights for your tort, etc In this way you don't need to be making them and you clearly own the rights to the recipe. You could then even offer to "consult" with the employees on how to actually cook them, etc.

No, Bush did not deceive the American people. Please consider the following information as reference:\n\nIraqis can participate in three historic elections, pass the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and form a unity government despite terrorist attacks and provocations.

Like swallows to Capistrano, they keep returning to the same allegations--the president misled the\ncountry in order to justify the Iraq war; his administration\npressured intelligence agencies to bias their judgments; Saddam Hussein turned out to be no threat since he didn't possess weapons of mass destruction; and helping democracy take root in the Middle East was a postwar rationalization. The problem with these charges is that they are false and can be shown to be so--and yet people continue to believe, and spread, them. Let me examine each in turn:\n\nThe president misled Americans to convince them to go to war. "There is no question [the Bush administration] misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq," according to Ted Kennedy. Jimmy Carter charged that on Iraq, "President Bush has not been honest with the\nAmerican people." And Al Gore has said that an "abuse of the truth" characterized the administration's "march to war." These charges are themselves misleading, which explains why no independent body has found them credible. Most of the world was operating from essentially\nthe same set of assumptions regarding Iraq's WMD capabilities. Important assumptions turned out wrong; but mistakenly relying on faulty intelligence is a world apart from lying about it.\n\nLet's review what we know. The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the intelligence community's authoritative written judgment on specific national-security issues. The 2002 NIE provided a key\njudgment: "Iraq has continued its [WMD] programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of U.N. restrictions; if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade."\n\nThanks to the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission, which\ninvestigated the causes of intelligence failures in the run-up to the war, we now know that the President's Daily Brief (PDB) and the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief "were, if anything, more alarmist and less nuanced than the NIE" (my emphasis). We also know that the intelligence in the PDB was not "markedly different" from that given to Congress. This helps explains why John Kerry, in voting to give\nthe president the authority to use force, said, "I believe\nthat a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security." It's why Sen. Kennedy said, "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." And it's why Hillary Clinton said in 2002, "In the four years since the inspectors, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild\nhis chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program."\n\nBeyond that, intelligence agencies from around the globe believed Saddam had WMD. Even foreign governments that opposed his removal from power believed Iraq had WMD: Just a few weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom, Wolfgang Ischinger, German ambassador to the U.S., said, "I think all of our governments believe that Iraq has produced\nweapons of mass destruction and that we have to assume that they continue to have weapons of mass destruction."\n\nIn addition, no serious person would justify a war based on\ninformation he knows to be false and which would be shown to be false within months after the war concluded. It is not as if the WMD stockpile question was one that wasn't g
There are several controversial issues involving the penal system. I could not say which one is the most controversial, but here are the issues I hear of most often:\n1. Should non-violent offenders be sent to prison when our prisons are already overcrowded?\n2. Should juveniles ever be tried as adults?\n3. Can pedophiles ever be truly rehabilitated?
Gary Sinise... but I'd have to say in his earlier years, Ed Harris could certainly hold his own. Only lately has he gotten a more aged look - which is only natural. But yeah, my vote is for Gary, he definately ages gracefully!
I'm social phobic too. Some days are worse than others but generally, every time I leave my home and put myself in a social situation (even if it's just going to the local corner store) my mind is racing with thoughts about people looking at me, judging me or waiting for me to make some sort of embarrassing mistake. No matter how much I tell myself how irrational these thoughts are, it still doesn't take away the anxiety. It has affected my life and still does to a certain extent.\nThere are a couple of things you can do about it. You can go see your doctor and he/she will put you on an anti-anxiety medication like Paxil or something similar to it and maybe even give you something to deal with acute anxiety too, like Clonazepam. Just make sure you research the side effects of anything your doctor puts you on because with anti-anxiety meds, you do have options. (I know what you're thinking....this means you have to sit in the waiting room at the doctor's office and even worse yet, you have to walk through the door not knowing how many people are going to be looking at you).\nThe other thing that you'll find helpful is to establish a comfortable place outside of your home, like a park or a daily trip through the drive-through at a coffee shop. The reason for this is that it will expand your comfort zone. It's tough to do at first but locking yourself up in your home will only amplify your anxiety when you do have to go out. Familiarity goes a long long way.\nYou might always feel anxious when you go somewhere and it feels even worse when you HAVE to go somewhere. Don't psych yourself up about it, just do it......and remember, you're not alone dealing with this sort of thing.\nHope this helps!

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.
i hate it...my family lived here for almost 16 years.....i was born in U.S when we lived here for only 2 years.......we had nothing but we still managed to get ourselfs up....all of those people comin in illegally are ruining it for all of us they embarras me and its not fair then they expect us to help them out.........forget them
The intent of this amendment was clear, but in today's world there may be need for an adjustment. The problem of abuse is a big issue, and with thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants streaming into this country for the sole purpose of giving birth on US soil, something needs to be done. This is a different era than in 1776, when Muslim terror was not even dreamed of and Mexico was virtually non-existent. But today, with the Mexican government clearly backing illegal immigration to the United States, and with the President of Mexico meddling in US politics, changes need to be made. Children of illegal immigrants should be exempted from the protection afforded by this amandment. Children should bear the same citizenship of their parents, so the child of an illegal Mexican immigrant born in the US would legally be a Mexican citizen. International criminals (including Muslim terrorists) should not be afforded the Constitutional protections of American citizens, but instead should fall under the jurisdiction of a military tribunal. This is after all, OUR country, not theirs.
No! We shouldn't support illegals.\n\nThis is a very complex issue because there are very good pro's & con's. \n\nIt seems to me that the illegals will work harder and for less pay but by the same token I have also seen Americans working the same way. Example, I have a friend that work as a housekeeper for a national hotel chain. She works 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day. She gets paid more than minimum wage but less than $10 an hour and she has had this job for more than 10 years.\n\nI believe that America should take care of our own first but by no means ignore the rest of the world.\n\nI don't think we should make the existing illegals felons but I also don't think we should give another blanket amnesty. So where is the happy medium I don't know. I wish I were smarter so I could come up with it.

Used to represent a "life-style", it was very smartly advertised in the 50´s and 60´s, and must of the famous people around the world used to smoke, even public presenters and performers used to do this in front of the camera, so there were 3 or 4 generations that growth with that cliche of smoking is cool, but from 80 to our days, there is being a social campaign of consciousness of the big damage it can produce to human body, so nothing cool with smoking anymore, other than a teen-age believe the top of the adult by smoking...

Oxford became an established seat of learning as early as the 11th century, but the University as we know is today did not start to take shape until the 12th century. In 1167, due to a dispute with France, Henry II banned all English scholars from attending the University of Paris. Many of these exiled scholars congregated at Oxford and the University began a period of rapid development.

laissez-faire (lĕs'ā fâr`) [Fr.,=leave alone], in economics and politics, doctrine that an economic system functions best when there is no interference by government.

Truth be told all Mormons are required to do a certain period of missionary work,whether it be at home or abroad. I'm certain that any expenses and basic needs will be met by the church during that,but as far as an actual salary I think not.However since the Mormon church has built for themselves a very comfortable little world for their followers I am certain that no Mormon who gives of their time to missinary requirements is going to suffer financially for it.\n\nAD

One way to do it is to make Class1 call some other class for all actual implementation. So you make a new class, Class1Impl, which does all the real work. Class1 has a pointer to Class1Impl, and all of the member functions of Class1 call the appropriate member function of Class1Impl. You don't need to give out the header for Class1Impl as it can just be predeclared at the top of the Class1 declaration. \nEx:\n//class1.h\nclass Class1Impl;\n\nclass Class1\n{\nprivate:\nClass1Impl* m_pImpl;\n\npublic:\n Class1();\n void DoStuff();\n};\n\n//Class1.cpp\n#include "Class1.h"\n#include "Class1Impl.h"\n\nClass1::Class1()\n{\n m_pImpl = new Class1Impl;\n}\n\nvoid Class1::DoStuff()\n{\n m_pImpl->DoStuff();\n}\n\n//class1impl.h\n//hidden, never give this source out\nclass Class1Impl\n{\nprivate:\n long m_lHiddenVal;\npublic:\n void DoStuff() { printf("Woo! %d", m_lHiddenVal); }\n};

Do you REALLY want to know the answer to this question?\n\nThe answer to why chickens lay eggs is in reproduction. Just as women have monthly cycles of discarded eggs, so do chickens. The eggs you eat are the bi-product of the reproduction cycle in the form of an unfertilized egg. That red spot you might see on occasion, that's a fertilized egg and was the beginning of a chick but plucked from the nest before it had a chance to mature. In most commercial hen houses where chickens are housed in small cages, there are no roosters.\n\nI don't think chickens lay eggs every day and that is why you would usually need more than one if you want eggs on a daily basis, but chickens do lay often.

Blue Barrel\n\nIn reference to petroleum, specifically oil and natural gas liquids, bbl is an abbreviation for 1 barrel, equal to exactly 42 U.S. gallons, or approximately 159 liters. The abbreviations 1 Mbbl and 1 MMbbl are generally accepted to mean one thousand and one million barrels respectively. (In non-industry documentation Mbbl can sometimes stand for one million barrels.) While North American markets typically measure oil in barrels, elsewhere oil is more commonly measured in cubic meters and less commonly in metric tonnes. Natural gas is measured differently.\n\nIn the early 1860's, when oil production began, there was no standard container for oil, so oil and petroleum products were stored and transported in barrels of all different shapes and sizes (beer barrels, fish barrels, molasses barrels, turpentine barrels, etc.). By the early 1870's, the 42-gallon barrel had been adopted as the standard for oil trade. This was 2 gallons per barrel more than the 40-gallon standard used by many other industries at the time. The extra 2 gallons was to allow for evaporation and leaking during transport (most barrels were made of wood). Standard Oil began manufacturing 42 gallon barrels that were blue to be used for transporting petroleum. The use of a blue barrel, abbreviated "bbl", guaranteed a buyer that this was a 42-gallon barrel.
When English speakers hear "achoo," they usually respond with either "Gesundheit" or "God bless you." Gesundheit was borrowed from German, where it means "health". \n\nWishing a person good health when they sneezed was believed to forestall the illness that a sneeze might indicate. "God bless you" had a similar purpose. \n\nIt was once believed the soul could exit the body during a sneeze, causing ill health. Folks said "God bless you" to ward off this danger.

Well, let's face it--as long as there are "guys and girls," when people see them "together," they're gonna think that there's some hanky-panky going on. First, ask yourself--why do you care what they think? If you and your girl "friend" are fine with being friends, it doesn't matter that folks link you romantically. Friends can be very intimate, verbally and physically, so yeah, people might get the wrong idea. It's as natural as anything else, logically. However, if the indifferent approach doesn't work, then ask yourself this--do you have "secret" feelings about her, or does she have them about you? If it truly bothers you, for other reasons than "other people's opinions," then you might be doing your friendship a great service by checking in with your gal-pal. Maybe one or both of your feelings have changed? Perhaps it's a good idea to check in, just in case. Otherwise, if you and your friend are happy, who cares what others think? Life's too short to let other folks' judgments ruin an excellent relationship.

The first one to answer had a point, no one really knows if the universe is infinite. But, assuming it is, some one else said that stars dont comprise the most matter in the universe. Only stars make up only 3 percent of the total matter in the universe, dark matter and dark energy comprise about 90 percent of the matter. And remember that stars usually form in clusters (nebulae) to form galaxies. But yeah, no one really knows if the universe is inifinite or not, I mean Voyager 1 and 2 have only just left the gravitational reach of our sun, so we still have a long way to go.

Dermatologists often call dry skin arising in later life ‘xerosis’, ‘asteatosis’ or ‘acquired ichthyosis’. \n\nThe dry areas may result in dermatitis, i.e. the skin becomes red and itchy. This may result in a crazy-paving appearance on the lower legs (‘eczema craquelé’), or round patches scattered over the trunk and limbs (a dry form of nummular dermatitis). Sometimes the dry skin is just itchy, without much of a rash (sometimes known as ‘winter itch’, ‘7th age itch’, or ‘senile pruritus’). \n\n \nIchthyosis \nClose-up of ichthyosis \nDermatitis from dry skin \n\nCauses of dry skin\nFactors which contribute to dry and cracked skin include: \n\nInherited factors \nMetabolic factors such as an underactive thyroid gland, or excessive weight loss. \nIncreasing age, resulting in decreased natural lubrication. \nCool weather, especially when windy or the humidity is low. \nAir conditioning, central heating or sitting close to a fire or fan heater. \nExcessive bathing, showering or swimming, especially in strongly chlorinated hot or cold water. \nContact with soap, detergents and solvents. \nFrictional irritation and chapping. \nTreatment of dry skin\nAn important aspect of treatment is to identify and tackle any contributing factors (see the list of causes above). \n\nReduce how often you bath or shower, and use lukewarm water. Showers may be better than baths. \nReplace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, etc. \nApply an emollient liberally and often, particularly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. \nTreat eczematous patches with a topical steroid for a 5 to 15 day course. These are prescribed by your doctor and should be only applied to the red and itchy areas. \nLong term control\nDry skin is usually a long term and recurring problem, especially in winter. When you notice your skin getting dry, resume your lubricating routine and use a non-soap cleanser. If the itchy dry-skin rash returns, use both the lubricating routine and the prescription steroid cream or ointment. \n\nso now u can work out what u got...so is the treatment...\n\nis it usfull...if not pls contact me..\n\nget well\ngood luck
Ahmadinejad, all the way. Chavez can over react a little. W can be just plain thoughtless, redundant, and a little ignorant. Ahmadinejad on the other hand is stupid and inflammatory. Not a good combo.
If it's confirmed that this is a pulled muscle, go out quickly and buy a tube of arnica gel, preferably A.Vogel or Roberts. These are the ones available at health shops and better chemists. I don't find the Weleda so effective. \n\nAs you rub it in to the pulled muscle the skin feels very cold and within five minutes there is quite a dramatic reduction of pain. Keep massaging it in a few times a day and the pain will go quicker than if arnica not used. Arnica gel is used by physios on sports injuries to muscles.

Each person has two genes that determine their blood type. with an A+, they would have either two A+'s, or an A+ and an A-. It is the same with B+. They will have either two B+'s, or a B+ and a B-. Each parent will contribute one gene to their child. So if the parents each contribute a negative blood type (B- and A-) then the child will be AB-. Negative blood types are recessive, and need two of them to be present in order for the blood type to be the dominant one. in all other scenarios (parents both donating positive blood A+ and B+, or one parent donating positive, the other negative A+ B-, or A- B+) the child will have AB+ blood type.\n\noh, there is a possibility that each parent is carrying a recessive O gene. in the case that both parents give the child an O gene, the child will have type O blood.\n\n\ni hope this answered your question, but i am unsure what you are talking about with the 7?

in sixth grade i was playing center field going for a fly ball , i called off the left fielder and he drops to the grass bounced back up and clipped me in the left leg breaking my knee and growth plate. a year later they found my leg grew crooked because it broke only half of my growth plate. so they took a chunk of bone and straightened my leg and stopped all growth in my right leg. well it stopped my growth at 6'2" at 12 years old. i was supposed to be 6'7". i also have size 18 feet.
A linear equation is an equation involving only the sum of constants or products of constants and the first power of a variable. Such an equation is equivalent to equating a first-degree polynomial to zero. These equations are called "linear" because they represent straight lines in Cartesian coordinates. A common form of a linear equation in two variables is \ny = mx + c \n(e.g. y = 3x + 5)\nIn this form, the value m will determine the slope or gradient of the line; and the value c will determine the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. Equations involving terms such as x2, y1/3, and xy are "non-linear".

Basic idea is that men are less sensitive than women.\n\nSo men are better at heavy physical labor and adverse environments (e.g. hot kitchen of a restaurant). Also men are more comfortable with uncertainty (mainly b/c they do not give a sh*t) e.g. in business management. \n\nWomen are better when attention to detail is needed, or maintaining something in order, or at dealing with people.
Certain anthropological discoveries revealed that in those earlier times of human evolution, mothers used to feed their infants mouth to mouth by chewing food, the same way birds feed their own. This act seem to have been slowly took form in kissing lip to lip. I believe this particular act is so sensual as it combines all five senses in to a singular activity. closer proximity of the person's face fill our vision, their moaning are heard by ears, nose smells the partner's aroma and taste and touch are with the lips and tongues entangled with each other.... I hope this is the right answer that will quench your curiosity

Good answers, all. For gaming, Max out your Video RAM, bump your system RAM to 1 gig. \n\nAnd go through your Start-up programs to cut back on the number of TSR's that boot. (Minimize the number of little icons in the lower right corner of your screen by the clock). Defrag at least bi-weekly if you are gaming a lot, like daily. \n\nWhen you use a piece of a game program it pulls it from the main game folder into RAM, then when you're finished with that game module or file (like a sound file or a graphic image file), it gets placed back out of RAM onto the HDrive. But not necessarily where it came from, just back to some open memory address on the HD. Kinda like you going to the Library and taking a book off the shelf, looking at it, ripping out 15 pages, then putting the book back on another shelf, but putting the 15 pages on 12 other shelves. Kinda hard to finish the book. Same for PC's and any program you run on them. It has to go looking for those "pages". Defrag puts the "book" back together in page order.
I go further back than that (UK). In the late 50's when the British Government were building their first Nuclear Power Stations they boasted that electricity would be so cheap in the 1980's that it would be uneconomical to read meters and send out bills. But would you ever have believed even 25 years ago that people would be paying prime prices for water now. In fact it is dearer than petrol over here.
Understanding , Compassion, Patience
First and foremost, be yourself. You wanna first talk about what is in the surrounding enviroment, clothing etc. Be a customer, ask questions, not too many, and don't go to far into personal detail about yourself. You don't wanna tell a girl everything right off the bat, cause then there wouldn't be that getting to know you stage. Keep her curious, and make her laugh. Be confident, smile and get her curious. Compliment her but don't go overboard. Don't use words like hot, sexy, your fine. Use words lik beautiful, nice, proper words not slangs. Keep eye contact. Don't look at her breast or behind, no matter how tempting it may be, don't do it. Don't bug her, don't harras her, just go with the flow. If its not there, learn from it and move on. If it is there, than you'll see it in her smile and her eyes, if you pay attention to those two things than you can learn alot from a womans heart. Remember the expression, Your words say one thing but your eyes say another. The eyes are always right

If you are experiencing depression, social anxiety, and body dysmorphia, your values of yourself seem quite low and/or negative.\n\nI imagine these medications you're on cloud those particular values you have for yourself. As a result, they make you feel alienated from yourself, that self that is consistently negative toward itself. :) This is in theory "for the better," but if you don't mentally understand why, the chemicals you're injesting will, I surmise, only "hollowly" pick you up, leaving you feeling alienated and without guidance on where to go after feeling this "elevation."\n\nYou'll have to be more specific what you mean by "maintaining friendships when getting used to an anti-depressant." Are you having trouble maintaining ones you already have and have had for a while given your new state? Are you simply having problems sustaining relationship with people you just met? You can see your question is a bit vague to get a precise answer.\n\nHowever, I am like another Answerer who suggests seeking advice from your counselor. In particular, it should be known very explicitly to your psychiatrist that you are having trouble maintaining friendships, and have had this experience in the time you've been getting used to your anti-depressant. If this is new for you, this experience, there may be a direct relationship between the two that alarms the psychiatrist. Or, it may be a small symptom of taking the medication. It's probably partially up to your psychiatrist to decide, and partially up to you.\n\nI would generally recommend taking your time maintaining friendships, whether you're depressed, on medication, or whatever your condition might or might not be. Friendships when forced can turn the friends off to each other. Letting friendships form naturally, meaning letting them form or not form, is a nice alternate recommendation. A better recommendation is seeking out a support group, especially one that socializes after the meeting. That way you'll be able to maintain friendships via consistent meetings, and learn about others interests, plus your own, and then make friends via the understanding of common interests. More than likely, if people are attending a support group for mental illnesses, they have plenty of common interests, not to mention common experiences very much like your own with respect to getting used to anti-depressants!\n\nI hope some of these thoughts are helpful for you. Get well soon! :)

Sorry to disappoint you mate- but it's impossible! Girls are the most unpredictable of all God's creations (trust me- I'm a girl). But, if you really want to know a girl inside out, then the best way is to become her best friend. This works especially if you're a boy, because girls tend to tell boys things they might not always tell other girls. So, listen to her, and talk to her, and get to know her, and you'll start to get a rough idea of what's on her mind. Also, pay attention to her body language, and expressions. It works sometimes! But be warned, no two girls are alike, and sometimes, even the girl doesn't really know how she feels, and when she does, she probably won't tell you... It's an art that takes time and practice... You could just ask her what's on her mind, I suppose!

RUN FAR AWAY from Amway, and don't let anyone talk you into signing up! It is a SCAM (even though it's legal) and you'll invest far more time and money into it than you get back. In fact, you'll be lucky to get anything back at all. Look on google, there are support groups and websites for people who have been burned by Amway. The peer pressure that the people in this group will give you is unbelievable. It's the closest thing to a cult that a non-religious group can get!\n\nLOL Looks like the MLM people found you here. They'll do anything to hook you in and get you in their group! Theoretically it would work if you got a lot of people signed up under you, but the truth is people run when you mention Amway or any other MLM group, so you're not going to do anything except make your friends and family leery of hanging around you. People don't like their friends trying to take advantage of them by pressuring them into a "business opportunity." And if you try to rope in someone who's already into an MLM business, they'll just try to get you into theirs. Perfect example: some of the people who have already posted to you.

Spam email will disappear when it is no longer economically feasible for the spammers. As long they can send out a few million spam emails and make a couple of million dollars on that they will continue to do it. SO the answer lies with people who receive the spam email NEVER responding to or buying anything from a spam email they have received. It's not the spammers' fault that these spam emails keep coming; it's the fault of the people who receive them and respond with wads of cash.\n\nThis is the same reason why prostitution is still going strong after thousands of years: there is a market for it that is positively insatiable.
Air does contain oxygen, but is actually something like 70 to 75% nitrogen, as well as other inert gases like carbon dioxide. People that need oxygen for medical uses carry pure oxygen in those tanks - usually, it's because they can't get enough filtered through their lungs and circulatory system. This is pretty simplistic, I'm sure somebody will give you a more technical explanation.\n\nI forgot about altitude - good catch on that one! \n\nAnother interesting thing - deep sea divers don't use pure oxygen in their tanks, I think it's usually a mixture of helium and oxygen (though this may have changed, it's been several years since I learned that). I think the reason is that when your lungs are functioning properly, pure oxygen can make you "high" or dizzy...hence the "oxygen bar" fad a few years ago.

Cheerleading is definitely a sport and I really don't think we get the credit that we deserve. We work our butts off 5 or 6 days of a 7 day week, support Football, Basketball, Wrestling, Soccer...(almost all sports!) We tumble, dance, and stunt. \nA sport is a competitive physical activity right? Well, isn't that basically what cheer is?\nCheer is competitive as well as physical....\nWe attend competitions, just as football players compete in games. Cheer is one of the most hardcore sports out there! Not to mention the most dangerous! People really need to cut us a break. Whoever says cheer is not a sport serisously needs to reevauate what a sport actually is!
Yes, the poor will. GST actually is an indirect tax where the poorer will pay more.
I so agree with you! There is no reason to take tradition out of holidays and the classroom. As a child I loved the Christmas parties we had before Christmas vacation. Now we can't call it Christmas vacation its winter break, and most classrooms aren't even allowed to have a Christmas tree in them. We can still have a winter party as long as it doesn't have any traditional Christmas images, this includes Santa (because if he doesn't represent all races it is also politically incorrect) For reasons like these, I stopped teaching and am homeschooling my children, they are being robbed of some very fun activities because of a few people that just don't get it.\nWhat cracks me up is we can't pray in school even if we want to but then there are others fighting to be allowed to pray to their Gods because their religion requires pray at certain times of the day.\nWe have tried so hard to make everyone else feel welcome and happy that we have forgotten about the whole premise on which this country was founded on, the freedom of religion.\n\nHappy Holidays and have a GREAT day!\n\nPS... For all those saying Christmas is a pagan holiday... yes and no, all of our holidays have traditions from other religions from around the world not just paganism. And, technically since being celebrated in the states it has been considered by most a Christian holiday (regardless of the original origins) for the Christians that say it wasn't even Jesus’ real b-day, you are right, but it is the day that was chosen to observe it, considering the calendar had been changed so many times we really have no idea when it was.

You need to establish for what purpose they are learning English. There are threee main areas to language; speaking, & listening, reading then writing. It takes longer for non native speakers to sound native once they reach around age 12, on the other hand the true second languge learner (one who already reads, write and composes in correct gramatical form in their native language) will be able to comprehend and produce more content area language than younger learners. Younger than 12 year olds will sound more like native English speakers at an amazing rate but may have little to no idea what they are saying. If your Spanish speaker already is a literate Spanish language learner there will be alot of transfer (translation & relation) to their native language. The easiest thing to do is find out what they know alot about that you also know alot about (perhaps the Bible, Hollywood movies, music) and do lessons/conversations around this topic. Provide as much illustrations and props as possible. Good luck from a second language learner & teacher=:

Having a large gun (automatic pistol, probably a 45 or a 9mm) shoved in my chest by a guy wanting money, of which I only had $3.23 on me and/or my leather jacket, then a guy at the end of the car started talking crazy, distracted the guy with the gun long enough for a REALLY big dude to grab my coller, pull me out of my shock and my seat and yank me to the next car, then at the next stop he shoved me out of the car and told me to run. I wanted out of there so bad, I never turned to thank him for saving my life.

George W. Bush is a multifaceted man. He is definitely a social conservative--and in that, he and I have absolutely nothing in common--, but he is also not a raging nationalist (and I celebrate the latter, especially with regards to immigration). He is pro big business, but he is not an economic conservative (his administration's spending is extraordinarily high). It also is the case that there have been spectacular changes between the two administrations he's lead. The first four years were dominated by dismal decision-making, war-mongering, deception, terrible self-inflicted damage to the image of the US internationally, foolish foreign policy, etc. The second Bush administration has been orders of magnitude better on the foreign policy front, with Condoleeza Rice at the helm (now the US is finally learning to talk to leftist governments in Latin America, for example, rather than to shun and isolate them, creating the sort of resentment that doesn't help the US in the long run).\n\nI have cringed at the Supreme Court nominations of Mr. Bush, particularly that of Samuel Alito. And I am appalled by the reluctance of this administration to set free Gitmo prisoners who have already been tried and found innocent of any wrong-doing. I think there's much more we will learn (hopefully) about domestic spying, and when all is said and done, History will remember Mr. Bush rather unkindly as a President, given his penchant for secrecy, for engaging in serious violations of the law of the land, and for hypocritical political maneuvers like unclassifying classified documents by issuing orders to *leak* the information to the press.\n\nBut Bush the man seems rather affable, and I cannot bring myself to blame him for everything that has gone wrong with his administration. He gives me the impression of being somewhat incompetent for the position he holds, of being stubborn to the point of stupidity--like Stephen Colbert said yesterday nigh, the Presiden is a man who believes on Wednesday what he believed on Monday, despite what happened on Tuesday--, and of having selective episodes of compassion--as in the case of illegal immigrants--and responsibility--as was the case when Mr. Bush, to my astonishment and profound delight--came out in support of the Muslim American community, calling on citizens not to make our plight into a religious conflict.

hmm GC needs a sample to find out the composition, so that won't work. One way to find the compositions is to use either absorption or emmision specrtoscopy. Each elements have a specific "fingerprint", as the electrons in the atom are only able to absorb/emit specific amounts of energy (or wavelngths of light) this is shown by the lines on a spectroscopy.

A narrative is a comprehensive summary that could be published (in the newspaper for example) and should include such things as the definition of the project scope and limits, the purpose/intent/result of the project, the materials to be used, schedule, costs, funding sources, etc., as well as name of the owner, designer, inspector, and contractor. Keep it clear, simple, and easy for any common person to understand. Do not drown your reader in details.

I think that the best way to promote cultural awareness in the school community is to provide students and faculty with cultural events that are happening in your local community, providing local and inexpensive trips to the museums that are not cultural limited, getting students involved by doing research on different cultures that they are unaware of, surveying the community with things for example:( Do you listen to hip hop? Well if you do did you know that hip hop originated.....) you know something in that manner. Well there are alot of things that I would do to ensure that people know about other people culture besides there own.

It's more of a question of when. If we are watching movies - Cuddles. Seeing each other for the first time that day- Hugs. While doing "things"- Hugs. After doing "things"-Cuddles. While walking around-more cuddly (linked arms and such). When he or i say something cute- hugs.\n\nGet the idea?
I don't think the shrews are going to bite your grandchildren unless they are catching the shrews and handling them. They would probably not be able to catch one. When was the last time you were bit by a mouse in your house! They are not going to attack or anything...they are going to try to avoid you and much as you would like to avoid them. Try to find where they are getting in and block the entrance. Put out Sherman live trap, this trap does not kill them, catches them so you can relocate them far from your home.\n\nhttp://www.shermantraps.com/

yeah, he's not over it either. if you want to get over him, you have to cut off all contact, at least until you feel like you don't want to see him anymore. it's probably going to be longer since he still has feelings for you too. and if you were talking about what to do next but you know its not going to work, i wouldn't even put in the effort. if you think it won't work it won't. i think you're just sad cuz you hurt his feelings, because you know it wouldn't work out anyway. just move on.

i believe angels exist. i also believe they have free will. In Isaiah the prophet says that the greatest of the angels was Lucifer and he aspired to God's throne. He said he would make himself like the Almighty. OK, this is open rebellion. and a third of the angels in heaven followed him! you've got to wonder what the problem was with a third of the angels that they would rather follow Lucifer than the Lord. And it says that war was in Heaven and Lucifer and the angels that followed him were cast out of Heaven.\n\nSounds like a lot of free will to me.

So here it is there has been no war crimes, If saving a country from a mad man who has slaughtered his own people with chemical weapons is a crime then what is helping humanity. Most of the civilian losses in the war are from the ignorance of the people- they stand outside during a firefight watching the battle (common sense says not to due that). \n\nLets see rebuilding schools, hospitals, power plants, water purification sites. Yea real war crimes there.\n\nMedical attention to the population- another war crime in the making.\n\nGee if only the media would tell the People of the the World the real truth instead of the half truths that sell.\n\nIf anyone should be held responsible for war crimes it should be the media - just ask the 200 detainees who were killed because of the detainee abuse coverage- insurgent bombed a prison in Iraq as retaliation there's your war crimes.
There exists no generally accepted distinction. But there are a few disnctions that people support. Most notably is that Morality descibes interpersonal relationships, wheares Ethics is a quasi-scientific study of sysytems of morality.\n\nI think it was Kant who made my favorite distiction, that Morality is how I wish to be treated, whereas Ethics are how I wish everyone to be treated. A difference of scale, if you will.

Yes it is true that elves or dwarfs exist. Elves don't but dwarfs do. Congenital dwarfism is actually termed skeletal or chondrodysplasia and is literally premature closure of the growth plates or failure of the long bones to form properly. Sometimes it is a genetic defect that interferes with bone growth, sometimes a pituitary disorder.

That's not necessarly true. They love LIBERAL Christians. But hate all the Christians that speak out against Homosexuality and Abortion, two subjects the city prides itself on (In the name of Liberty and Personal Freedom). San Francisco has been gay since the 1940's, but didn't come out of the closet until the early 1970's when Mayor Masconi and Harvey Milk invited the LGBTQ all there. San Francisco is the most ultra-liberal city in California, that is because of the largely LGBTQ population, abortion rights advocates and Hippies and Emos of all ages. Christianity is fundamentally stands against the philosophies they hold dear, which are "Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love is the law." and "Tune in, turn on and drop out" AND "Do your own thing, just as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else", Christians believe in following God's law and believe if you are "doing your own thing" you are actually following your own evil impulses.

I think they are telling the truth, "truth" being defined as that which the speaker honestly believes. Whether or not they are relating FACTS is another matter entirely. I think much of what they relate is influenced by media and prompting. \n\nMany people misunderstand hypnosis, falsely believeing that it is impossible to lie while in a hypnotic trance. Not true! It is not only possible, but quite common. Hypnosis puts a person into a state of mind which makes them highly suseptible to suggestion. The hypnotist has to be extremely careful not to plant a suggestion into the subject's mind, but this still happens anyway.\n\nSo, combining media influences with hypnotic suggestions, a subject will often fabricate what he believes the hypnotist is asking for. Technically the subject is not "lying", however. He honestly believes he is telling the truth. But in many cases it is only a creation of his mind, intending to satisfy the questioner. \n\nWith all that said, do I believe that some people have actually been abducted? I'm skeptical, but willing to consider SOLID evidence. So far I'm not convinced.
Many different guys have different ways of showing their affection. Some tease and play, while others approach relationships very seriously. If he pays a ton of attention to you, negative or positive, he probably likes you, but then you may be in the friend zone. \n\nMy advice: if you like him enough to be worth the trouble, confront him carefully. Tell him how you feel. Being desired (but not smothered) is a great turn-on. If he gives you a less than enthused answer, back off and give him room. Mystery and playing it aloof can also be big turn-ons. He may just come around, and if not, at least you've cleared the air and can move forward with someone else. But he might just say he likes you back, and voila - you've got yourself a budding relationship! Congrats! \n\nEither way, take it from someone who knows - life without telling people you like or love them is filled with regrets. Regrets bite. So put yourself out there and hope for the best! (And update so we know how it went). Best of luck!

To a certain degree, yes. \nBut things run in cycles. There was a lull in progressive music in the '80's after the "art-rock" explosion of the '70's. Then, during the latter part of the decade, "Prog" started to make a come-back. \nNow, it seems as though it's hit another lull in the amount of true prog-rock bands that are out there. However, there are several excellent "Prog-Art-Rock" bands around.(The Mars Volta, Univers Zero, Cryptic Vision, Kino, The Flower Kings, etc.) The real trick is finding any of their material - especially, in the U.S. (Try these websites: www.prog4you.com - or - progarchives.com)\nProg music will always be around - it just will never gain any sort of mainstream acceptance. Which is good, because look what happened to "Metal" in the '80's when it became popular. I'm glad something finally came along to slay that monster. But why did it have to be "Grunge"?

Acceleration towards the Earth is equal to the Earth's geocentric gravitational constant* (3.986 x 10^14 meters^3/sec^2) divided by the square of distance from the center of Earth (6378000 meters)^2. \n\nIn other words: (3.986 x 10^14)/(6.378 x 10^6)^2\n\nThat comes to about 9.8 meters/sec^2.\n\nAcceleration away from Earth due to the rotation of the Earth is equal to the square of the velocity divided by the radius of the Earth (6.378 x 10^6 meters). \n\nIn other words, v^2/r.\n\nThe Earth rotates 2(pi) radians per day, or about 7.292115 x 10^-5 rad/sec. You convert that to a linear velocity by multiplying the radius (6.378 x 10^6 meters) by the angular velocity (7.292115 x10^-5 rad/sec). At the equator, that comes to 465 meters/sec.\n\nSquaring the linear velocity (465 meters/sec) and dividing by the radius (6.378 x 10^6) gives you an acceleration of only 3.4 cm/sec^2 away from the Earth.\n\nIn other words, the acceleration towards the Earth due to gravity is about 288 times the centripetal acceleration away from the Earth. It's there, but the force of gravity is much stronger.\n\n* - the geocentric gravitational constant is just the universal gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the Earth.

I'm not going to give you the answers, because you can really work them out for yourself.\n\nYou need to work out the molecular weight, which is just the sum of the atomic weights in the appropriate proportions. Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.

Yes, I have vaginismus and am working on correcting it now. It is a condition where the the entry to the vagina tightens and causes pain when anything enters or touches it. I am still learning about it but I do know that it's only PARTLY psychological. My OB told me that its an actual condition. First and foremost if you speculate that your gf has this condition, do NOT have intercourse. It will make it worse! Second, she needs to see her OB. He will definitely be able to help. Mine prescribed lidocaine (which is a cream that numbs the skin) for me to use on myself. He said it is fixable but takes patience and work. He told me it could be up to 6 months before we have intercourse again. \nMy advice to you would be to 1. Be patient, supportive, and understanding with her. It is extremely painful. So it's understand not to want to have sex, or even look forward to it.\nI hope I helped!

Ask your doctor to check ALL of your hormone levels. Your body releases hormones all the time...it's just about the only constant in the human body. So that's where I'd start. Then you can try allergy medicine...could be sinuses...If there would not be any drug/drug contraindications, next sign of a headache take Benadryl. If this works...it's your sinuses.Whatever you do be persistent and DO NOT let your doctor treat you like a "head case". Pain is real whether the doctors know the reason for it or not!

Most mammals will produce tears in response to extreme pain or other stimuli, but crying as an emotional reaction is considered by many to be a uniquely human phenomenon, possibly due to humans' advanced self-awareness. Some studies suggest that elephants and gorillas may cry as well.\n\nIn nearly all cultures, crying is seen as a specific act associated with tears trickling down the cheeks and accompanied by characteristic sobbing sounds. Emotional triggers are most often anger and grief, but crying can also be triggered by sadness, joy, fear, humor, etc.\n\nIn many cultures, crying is associated with babies and children. Some cultures consider crying to be undignified and infantile, casting aspersion on those who cry publicly. In most western cultures, it is more socially acceptable for women to cry in public than men, but this is certainly not true for all human cultures.\n\nAn insincere display of grief or dishonest remorse is called crocodile tears, from the ancient anecdote that crocodiles would pretend to weep in order to lure prey [2].\n\nMany religions describe gods or prophets as crying:\n\nThe shortest verse in the Bible (in the King James Version of the Bible and some other English translations) is simply: "Jesus wept." \nJade is sometimes known as "tears of the Buddha". \nThe Qur'an describes Muhammad crying, and proclaiming: "This is an expression of the tenderness and compassion, which the Lord hath put into the hearts of His servants." \nThe Incas believed that silver was the "tears of the moon". \n\nMy readings

The word CARNIVORE can be used as a taxonomy term (order of mammals) or a diet term......but....\n\nNo, skunks are CARNIVORES and have very sharp canines to tear flesh. Many carnivores (by their taxonomy) however may be able to eat plants too and are called omnivores. Bears, like skunks, have very sharp canines, eat flesh, but also can eat berries, etc, so they are omnivores by diet. Our dogs and cats are also carnivores by taxonomy, but their diet is omnivorous esp since the pet food industry adds all sorts of veggies to the pet food. Left wild, undomesticated, many cats and dogs in the wild would perhaps hunt a lot more and eat more meat.\n\nAlso rodent taxon is not a family. Families end in -dae letters in the latinized term. Rodents are famous for their enlarged incisors that allow them to chisel-gnaw at their foods, typically vegetarian-herbivore. They do not have the emphasized canines found in carnivores.

Probably because America hates veterans but loves money!\n\nYou in Da Nang?\n\nJH, you might argue, but those ARE the FACTS!!\n\nBush sent the military into combat ill-equipped, unarmored Hum Vees, and families had to send their own children body armor that cost's $600.00! What did you do about that JH?\n\nBush likes vets so much he cut widows benefits to those whose spouse was killed in Iraq by 1/2, what did you do about that JH?\n\nBush cut Veterans hospitals by 8 BILLION in his 2006 budget after flat-lining them for 4 years! And that is after 3 years of people coming home missing arms and legs! What did you do about that JH?\n\nBush tried to cut Combat Pay to the military in Iraq but was not allowed to after the firestorm!\n\nThe government stonewalled vets from service connected disabilities for PTSD, Agent Orange and Blue! It took them 40 years to find the link between cancer and the defoliant’s, but that didn't stop people from dying of cancer or committing suicide! Where were you on that one jh?\n\nThe government denied there was anything to the Gulf War Syndrome and denied service connected disabilities! Guess what? There is A Gulf War Syndrome! Meanwhile vets were living under bridges! Where were you on that one jh?\n\nThere will be one from Iraq, mostly from enhaling depleted uraranium used in shells? There is going to be a lot of cancer that the government is going to deny they had anything to do with! Where are you going to be on that one jh?\n\nThe government was charging military who got ourt of the service for lost body armour in Iraq! $600.00 is a lot of money, especially because they had to cut it off you after you were wounded and it was soaked in blood! How you stand on that one jh?\n\nMilitary who were wounded in Iraq and many months later discharged from Walter Reed Hospital, were given a bill for their food when they left! Sen. Clinton had that changed! Where did you stand on that one jh?\n\nYou really think Bush cares about Vets? Do you think the majority of the people care about vets? Go to a Memorial day parade sometimes JH! Going to Walmart to buy a yellow ribbon magnet made in Japan for $4.99 and putting it on your vehicle is NOT supporting the troops jh!!\n\nCome sit on my side and see how your views might change, especially if you were wounded and then given a discharge from the service to go to an understaffed, underfunded VA. JUST LIKE WE DID! I have a Purple Heart and a Purple Heart plate on my vehicle! You want to know how many times people have approached me to even say hello? I can count them on 3 fingers! What do you yhink about that jh?\n\nI bet you did nothing to support the troops, but plenty to clamour for the continuation of a war that was lost in 2003! Am I right jh?

Fast paced music has a tendency to stimulate the mind. (Auditory stimulus) it makes you think, gets your creativiy flowing, and is generally exciting overall. \n\nIf you get the chance to see the movie "Better Living Through Circuitry" (available on dvd) You will see musician BT discuss this. in how it relates to humans on a tribal level.\n\nYou are probably smarter than the average person. most people just can't roll with fast paced music. That's not to say they are dummies. but most people into faster modes of music do tend to be brighter than most.

I agree with Kimberly.\nOur 1st graders also have a math problems with charts and graphs and 4 to 5 questions all about the graph on their tests. They begin 13-4=9, so I would say that is not just simple adding/subtraction. Fact families, telling time, counting money and making predictions and estimations. Coloring?! Who has time for that anymore?!\nYes, tests! And our schools use Spaulding which teaches all the sounds so the spelling test has dictation of sounds, sentences and spelling words. 15 spelling words+ 5 sentences and 5 different phonemes.\nThey also cut and paste which is important for eye hand coordination.
Until recently, a foreigner could only purchase land through a Mexican-based trust...meaning the foreigner technically did not own the land. Now, foreigners can own land outright but not in prime locations, eg. near the coast, near the border, etc...These still have to be purchased and held via the trust.\n\nIt's ironic that Mexico and Mexicans scream about US policy, when Mexico is 100 times more discriminatory with regard to its laws and policies concerning non-Mexicans, eg. foreign ownership of land, designating Spanish as the sole official language of Mexico, preventing foreign-born persons from holding large numbers of designated jobs that are reserved solely for native-born Mexicans, etc...etc...They are arguably the most hypocritical country in the Northern Hemisphere.
Well after one week hopefully you are still happy and shouldn't be in here asking for advise.
Do you think it's because nobody asked you out? Because if that's why, you should know that you can go out with your friends or even by yourself, if you really want to be out someplace. You don't have to sit home and wait for someone to invite you. \n\nMaybe you really want to be home - in any case you are, so why not enjoy your space instead of wasting your free time wondering 'why'?\n\nI love being home by myself but rarely get the chance since I work full time and have to catch up my housework, laundry and grocery shopping during the evenings so I can have few free minutes on the weekend. Time is precious.

Gamma distribution\n\nA gamma distribution is a general type of statistical distribution that is related to the beta distribution and arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant. \n\nBeta Distribution\nA general type of statistical distribution which is related to the gamma distribution. Beta distributions have two free parameters, which are labeled according to one of two notational conventions. \n\nWeibull distribution\nThe Weibull distribution gives the distribution of lifetimes of objects. It was originally proposed to quantify fatigue data, but it is also used in analysis of systems involving a "weakest link." \n\nCauchy distribution\nThe Cauchy distribution, also called the Lorentzian distribution or Lorentz distribution, is a continuous distribution describing resonance behavior. It also describes the distribution of horizontal distances at which a line segment tilted at a random angle cuts the x-axis. \n\nexponential distribution\nThe exponential distribution is the only continuous memoryless random distribution.

My advice would definitely be don't be someone you aren't because she would eventually find out that you are a phony.Maybe just come out ands ask her!If she says no just say "that's a loss for you".Sometimes girls will say no because they are embarrassed and don't want to answer something like that around someone like their Friends.I had the same problem as you do!If you only want to get a girl because she is "hot and popular" dont do it!Its not real!If that doesn't work go out with there Friend and if they realy like you they will become jealous and u get your girl!Don't hurt your own heat hurt, them by going out with their Friend!
"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of\nmass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.

For the\nrisks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons\nagainst us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18,\n1998\n\n"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." -\nSandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18,1998\n\n"We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution\nand laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on\nsuspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its\nweapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens.

Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports\nindicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to\npre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is\ndoubtless using the cover of an illicit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that\nwill threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bus h, Signed by Sen.\nBob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001\n\n"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and threat to the peace\nand stability of the region.

As a wedding planner I have a bias view, but I can tell you this much...\n\nA planner does NOT plan the wedding FOR you... a good planner plans it WITH you so that you get your dream wedding, all they do is take the pressure off of your shoulders (dealing with vendors, dealing with family disagreements over what SHOULD be, taking care of the Etiquette issues for you, etc)\n\nA planner will have connections you might not otherwise have, they already know the in's and out's of the business, they know who to contact when and will keep you on track and within your budget (not so many worries about going overboard if someone is always keeping you informed), If you get a REALLY good planner they might possibly be able to guarantee you that they will save you an amount equal to or greater than the fee you are paying for their services (effectively making their help FREE).\n\nThe drawbacks? Well, our services can be a bit pricey depending on what services you want and where you live. You also might find that wedding planners can be just as "shifty" as the next vendor... So DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Get references and CALL THEM! Find out how long they have been in business, how many weddings they have done, etc. Get DETAILS on how they are paid... do they only get paid by you? do they get "kickbacks" for using particular vendors? Etc. If they take kickbacks cross them off your list... this means they will use the vendor who pays them over a better one that doesnt, which causes a conflict of interest!\n\nIt can be daunting, but once you have the right planner..... it will be well worth it.\nIf you choose to go it alone.... GET HELP! Bridesmaids, Mothers, etc. You will need someone to help you keep on top of everything, and you might want to consider hiring a "Day of" coordinator anyway... that way it is all covered on your big day and you can rest easy.\n\nAlso, if you are having over 150 people it is a very good idea to have a planner, anything under 150 and its not as hard to Do it yourself.\n\nGood Luck, and if you have any other questions feel free to email me, I will do my best to assist you.

Your part of National Socialist German Workers Party. So your a Socialist.\n\nThe National Socialist German Workers Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (help·info)), better known as the NSDAP or the Nazi Party was a political party that was led to power in Germany by Adolf Hitler in 1933. The term Nazi is a short form of the German word Nationalsozialist shortened to two syllables, and spelled with -zi, because the ti syllable is pronounced [tsi] in German. After Hitler's appointment as Chancellor and the democratic election of the party to lead the German government in 1933, the NSDAP organized and established the Third Reich.\n\nSocialism is a social and economic system (or the political philosophy advocating such a system) in which the economic means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the people. This control may be either direct, exercised through popular collectives such as workers' councils, or it may be indirect, exercised through a State. In the latter case, the issue of who controls the state is crucial. A primary concern of socialism (and, according to some, its defining feature) is social equality and an equitable distribution of wealth that would serve the interests of society as a whole.\n\n Are you sure of what your asking.

You've got a couple of questions in there - not that I mind, they're good questions. :>\n\n1. "...does the potential for such technology warrant a renewed look by private industry and by government researchers?"\n\nEven without any bearing on manned space travel, absolutely. Think of the applications for medicine, to name a field... if we can put people into safe suspension for even 24 hours, imagine how much more effective and safer surgery would be. \n\n2. Now, as for manned space exploration... "it depends" kind of sums up the options. \n\n2A. What's the safety factor? \n\nI'm leery of cryogenics, for the reason that I'm not aware of any large-brained animal that can fully recover after having been frozen. Yes, I know, people have been revived after thirty minutes under the ice.. but I mean, frozen *solid.*\n\nI'm no expert on this subject. Please bring on citations to the contrary, but freezing one's brain has to be an order of magnitude more difficult than freezing the rest of one's body. I don't want to come out of the freezer unable to remember my name...\n\n2B. What's the scope? \n\nAlmost by definition we're talking about interstellar missions. The only way I can imagine that we'd seriously push for some kind of human estivation in interplanetary travel, is if there was some tremendous urgency in establishing bases in the outer solar system...\n\nFor example, solar-system-wide, international competition, first one there gets the helium 3 and a great view down the gravity well. That imperative would over-ride the hazards of daring such exceedingly long trips (Saturn, anyone?) with chemical propulsion. \n\nWithout such a driver, we'll just have to wait until nuclear rocket propulsion or magsails come on-line. \n\nBy definition, an interstellar voyage will be a long one- and an irrevocable one as well.\n\n2C. What's the mission? Colonization or exploration? \n\nIt was a common experience for immigrants to the United States, until about 50 years ago, to regard their trip here as an essentially one-way voyage. \n\nFuture emigrants from our solar system would have to have much the same attitude, regardless of travel velocity; therefore, travel velocity would play second fiddle, I think, to the overall object of getting a colony-sized vehicle up to *any* fraction of light. If so, then suspended animation would be hugely important, as it would avoid the enormous difficulties of a generation ship. \n\nI can grok a high-tau mission to a nearby star without hibernation - time dilation will shorten the trip considerably for the explorers. \n\nThat said... it's not unlike saying "Giant squid calamari will be the absolute best seafood ever" - one first must have caught a giant squid! So the last requirement for my post will have to be:\n\n2D. What's the engine technology? \n\nVoyaging at a high fraction of c would be great for a number of reasons, but, but, but. That's pretty advanced tech. And this too determines or influences a number of other decisions.
well congratulations on putting your children first. You are one of the first I have seen on here that does that and I thank you for making a positive contribution to our world by loving your children. Thank you. Secondly, yes, you are right, love is conditional. There is no such thing as unconditional love. There are cases with parents who don't love their children in many countries including our own. So love is conditional. The conditions are different with each individual. Someone who says I like you too much is saying "I have tons of fears that I am not able to cope with or calm myself". That's immaturity and lack of coping skills. Not a great sign but with therapy, they can learn to cope better. It also sounds like fear of abandonmnent. He most likely wasn't close to one or both of his parents or they have a bad relationship as about 50% of most couples do. This is traumatic to a child and if they're never given proper coping skills as a child, they don't just magically appear as an adult. \n\nIt isn't rude to expect unconditional love from a non relative but it is unrealistic. The key is how he interacts with them. He must respect that they come first, he is responsible for treating them with respect, appropriate discipline, appropriate love and appropriate affection for a non relative. That is something that you will have to monitor closely until they leave the nest. It's your responsibility.
no this game doesn't isn't so much about competition as it can be played on an individual basis much like the game of solitaire.\n\nit could mean a lot of other things why it looks like men are in the lead.\nthey could have lots more free time for example. or be total computer slaves and have no outside life.\n\nor it could be they are answering questions with one letter instead of typing responses out.\n\nwomen can be just as competitive as men, they just decide when and where and how they use their smarts to their advantage rather than go for an all out assault.
because all little boys start out as little girls, in the womb. Later in the pregnancy, their genitals descend, they start producing testosterone, and their breasts generally go un-developed
First off I realize that the human race is an animal but I like to think we are alittle bit above smelling a female in heat. Then jumping on. I think we have more of a choice who we sleep with then the normal animal. Usually there are feelings attached to having sex that animals lack.
patton thought so\n\nI think God has made sure that evil does not dominate the planet, and when people have truly worshipped Him (like most of the founding fathers) he has helped them\n\nrighteous causes have been helped by God when the people truly put faith in Him\n\npeace
It's possible, I'll bet it will happen within the next 5 to 10 years...I think David Stern would like to see 36 teams (six in each division), so I would look for 6 more expansion teams in the next 10 years. St. Louis is an obvious choice for one, Oklahoma City is also, Las Vegas maybe, Santa Fe, Kansas City, and maybe Cincinnati or Louisville could all have a shot at a pro team by then...you don't necessarily need to have a team change cities to St. Louis...maybe they'll merge with the ABA again and your Saint Louis Stunners can be an NBA team!!

I was 20 when my mother died. I wasn't at her side at the time, but this doesn't bother me much, because the last thing I did say to her was that I loved her. And, too, I've come to realize that we all really are on our own when we pass away---that's one journey we all must make alone. It's some consolation to me to realize that, and I hope it consoles you, too.\n\nThat said, I've often wanted to tell her again how much I love her. I do talk to her and tell her so. But I think the best way to tell her is to live my life as productively and respectably and happily as possible. I pursued an education, which I know she wanted. I practice as a physician, and I believe she is proud of me for that. I've married a wonderful man, and had beautiful kids. I think she approves. And I believe that by fulfilling her wishes for me (a full, happy, productive life), I'm telling her again and again how much I love her and appreciate all she did for me.\n\nI hope you can gradually feel better about this. I know it took me a long time. And sometimes it still hurts twentyone years later.
I've been in the clinic for 3 1/2 years and I've been detoxing for a while now. Don't do it to fast it can be really dangerous. Try going down the way I am, I drop down 2 mgs every other day for three weeks, then I take a break for two weeks. That way its not such a shock to your body. This has worked great for me and I've had 14 friends get off methadone and stay off this way. You could also call a doctor or a drug help line(you don't have to tell them your name). I don't know if they could help but it would be worth a try. Good Luck!!! If all else fails maybe you could try the program. But I would try on my own first if I were you, just be careful. If you start to feel bad you can always go back up for a few days.
If you want to think of it that way, then you are more than likely watching someone make money all the time!
Often treatment isn't necessary and your canker sore will heal on its own and there is no quick fix. Your doctor may suggest prescription medication if your sores are large, painful or persistent. To relieve the pain and irritation of canker sores, your doctor may recommend a prescription mouthwash, a corticosteroid salve or an anesthetic solution.

Bananas are a big favorite, as are avocados. I even mixed them together with a tiny bit of lemon juice & my twins loved it. Applesauce, cream of wheat, potatoes, green beans, carrots (pureed with cinnamon & a teeny bit of orange juice is a favorite at our house). The big thing is to introduce new foods slowly (every 2-3 days) just in case she has a reaction. Also, buy organic as much as you can -- those pesticides go a long way in a tiny little body.

I play piano, and my favorite song to play is "She's a Rainbow" by the Rolling Stones. I figured this out by ear because I couldn't find the sheet music to it anywhere.\n\nMy other favorite songs to play are the ones that I have written myself, because well they're easier to play because I wrote them. LOL
if it is meant to be it will be, you don't make a man love just like you can't keep them if they don't want to stay. Stop trying to force things and let them fall into place.
are you sure... it is usually if not always positive\nits probably only negative because the way it was setup.\nlike in a physics problems when a ball falls 20 feet in the negative y direction, it is often written -20 feet, but you cant really have a negative distance.

I believe its No.1 singles. She is like tied or beat Elvis. Im sure her website would say. Love her voice, and can't stop listening to her music but not too sure about her personally.
Being in a situation where you have no choice but to learn the language is the fastest way to learn, but if you listen to the music (works best if you choose a song you like listening to) and can find a web site that has translations for the lyrics, you can learn whole dialogs and conversational pronunciation. Just finding an English version of the song will not help as well because artists may have to change lyrics or verses to maintain the flow of the song as opposed to the meaning of the words.
For that first answerer: It is not entrapment. Entrapment is defined as forcing someone into doing something they wouldn't normally do. In other words, if I came up to you and asked you to sell me crack for 1 million dollars, you would probably hunt down the nearest drug dealer, take a ball bat to his head and and take his crack to sell to me. However if I asked you for the same amount of crack for its normal price, you'd tell me to pound pavement. These sting operations catch people in the act of doing something that they normally do. I hope they go to jail, and I hope one of the jailers violates his civil rights and tells the other inmates that this guy is a freakin' pervert.
I would recommend you focus on abs just once a week any type of crunch should do it. What you have to keep in mind is that the key to slim tummy is diet and aerobic workouts...so you are right on the money, eliptical machine should do it...good luck

do 5 minutes of abs a day... do 30 crunches, 30 toe touches (lay flat on your back w/ your legs straight up and lift your shoulderblades off the ground to touch your toes) hold 6 inches for 30 seconds, do 30 full sit-ups, then do 30 push-ups (no girl push-ups allowed!) then start back at 30 crunches and keep the rotation going w/o stopping until 5 minutes is up! it's pretty intense, but it RELLY works!
you have to sit her down and talk to her... agree before you start that neither one will get angry, or yell... and NO FIGHTING......\n\nthen you can each discuss your concerns... i am promising you though... this situation sounds like she doesn't agree with some of the things you do, and obviously it is not working for you either, so you will probly have to come to some sort of mutual agreement... compromise is the key, and no matter what... don't get mad... if you, as the daughter can control your temper, then she should see that and make an effort to do the same... if she gets mad, just give her some time to think about what you have said, and in that time you think about her points too... you can work it out... your dad seem to think so, or he wouldn't make you go back... so, at least try, and try and try again... she is bound to eventually see that you are making an effort to work things out... it won't get better overnight... you have to be patient in these sort of situations... and there sounds like there are anger issues too... try to talk those out as well...

What Is REM Sleep?\n\nUsually, REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after sleep onset. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes, with each recurring REM stage lengthening, and the final one may last up to an hour. Polysomnograms show brainwave patterns in REM to be similar to that recorded during wakefulness. In people without sleep disorders, heart rate and respiration speed up and become erratic during REM sleep. During this stage the eyes move rapidly in different directions.\n\nIntense dreaming occurs during REM sleep as a result of heightened brain activity, but paralysis occurs simultaneously in the major voluntary muscle groups. REM is a mixture of encephalic (brain) states of excitement and muscular immobility. For this reason, it is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.\n\nThe percentage of REM sleep is highest during infancy and early childhood. During adolescence and young adulthood, the percentage of REM sleep declines. Infants can spend up to 50% of their sleep in the REM stage of sleep, whereas adults spend only about 20% in REM.

The original idea was that if a public entity, such as a local city government, needed a piece of land, and the owner absolutely refused to sell, they could be forced to give it up at fair market value "for the common good." Today, it is being most horribly abused, to condemn people's land so it can be used for commercial enterprises like shopping centers. The Institute for Justice, which I think is www.ij.org, is on it. This (and other Libertarian fights against injustice) matters so much to me that I've named the Institute for Justice as the contingent beneficiary in my will. The fact that my estate is tiny is not the point; it's the thought that counts. Besides, a hundred tiny estates could add up to a pretty fair chunk of money.
:}\nAmerica is a truly diversified country.\nThe family of the 1950's was probably the last of the melting pot era whem there was something of a norm.\nWhen we forsook the idea of one nation, one people, and took on the idea of diversity (each people retaining their own heritage), we lost that standard. Now almost anything can be found.\nI fear we may have seen the seeds of disintegration.

They're not the greatest team ever. But they are doing pretty good this season. If they make it to the playoffs, then maybe even championships, they'll only lose to the Pistons.

because it is not the distance from the sun that makes out day but how the earth is tilted.\nThe Earth is tilted by 23 1/2 degrees. During the Summer months, \nthe north is pointed toward the Sun allowing more direct sunlight. \nDuring the winter, we are tilted away from the sun so the sunlight \nis more indirect as the sun seems lower in the sky. \nThere are 4 cardinal points in our calender; \nSummer solstice, autumnal equinox, winter solstice and vernal equinox. \nBeginning of summer, fall, winter and spring. This coincides \nwith the position of earth as it goes around the sun. \nEach of the cardinal days can take place over a three day period,\n 20th, 21st, 22nd. On June 22nd, summer solstice, it is the longest \nday of the year. It is also the day that the north pole is pointing \ndirectly at the sun. The next day it will have passed this point \nand start pointing away from the sun, hence, the days will also start \ngetting shorter. For further info, \nfeel free to email me, orion_1812@yahoo.com

We should care what other countries think about us because we use other countries resources.This isn't to say we wouldn't be fine without those resources however we don't want everyone to ebargo us... that would be detramental to our nation...Furthermore, there are some countries we just really don't need on our backs or bad side. Have you ever heard of a little thing called Pearl Harbor? Or how about this lil saying??? "It's not the size of the dog in the fight,but the size of the fight in the dog." if we upset too many countries and they team up against us then what might happen? We might not seem so powerful then in comparison...

All I can do is give you my gut feeling. It may ring true with you, it may not. \n\nIt seems to me you have a fear of taking a risk, or making a commitment to something. This could be a general fear or something specific in your life at present. You are concerned about the downside, of what could go wrong. It's a big fear, as almost killing a small child would be a terrible consequence. \n\nHaving to make a choice is consistent with this theme. You cannot sit on the fence forever. Sooner or later you have to take a risk or make a commitment. Otherwise you go nowhere. Maybe even go backwards. \n\nI'm not sure of the significance of the girl disappearing and reappearing. Possibly it represents her transformation from a victim to your conscience. Anyway, it's you talking. The ghost is you telling yourself you have to make a choice. \n\nThe girl as victim might also be you as well. Are you the one who stands to get hurt the most? Could you lose something of your inner child? Anyway the girl is strong. She has determination. But she also wants to suffer out of sight. Sounds like she doesn't want to ask for help. \n\nIt's very significant for you. Whatever it is, it's screaming at you! \n\nIf my interpretation rings true with you, you need to take more risks to get what you want, or commit to a specific course of action in something that is troubling you at present. And maybe you have to ask others for help. \n\nIf you take the action and the dream goes away, you have solved the problem. If not, you have to keep trying with other possible interpretations.
Caesar's tragic flaw was confidence/arrogance, along with the inability to take advice from others. Caesar thought he was untouchable and never contemplated his own friends would turn on him. He was warned by the Soothsayer, whose advice he did not listen to, and was advised by his wife to stay home; again he did not listen. If Caesar had been less sure of himself, he would have been more likely to listen to the advice of his wife (I can understand not listening to a random stranger on the streets). This would have saved him. Also, his arrogance was what led him to be killed in the first place. The other Senators were tired of Caesar's rule and afraid he was attempting to become Emporer. They wanted him stopped.

This is a difficult question because, from your statement, I'm guessing that you don't have a lien on the computers -- you just sold them to him and he has an outstanding balance. Thus, in general, you don't have a possessory interest in the computers (you're just his creditor--you have an interest in the $1,900). Thus, it is likely that you can't repossess the computers. You can allege a breach of contract (you performed and he didn't pay) and seek monetary damages ($1900 + interest) and perhaps seek recission of the contract (asking the court to "unmake" the contract) to result in the return of his money and his return of your pcs (although i'd guess that you couldn't resell them for the same retail value, since they're a year old).\n\nNonetheless, you do have to file an action -- try small claims court (sometimes call reconciliation court, or city court, or something like that, depending upon your state). Usually they can handle cases up to $2-3,000, and there are not a lot of formal requirements. Then you have a judgment upon which you could collect (by either him paying you or you attaching a judgment debtor lien on some of his property). Unless he's willing, it's highly unlikely that you could repossess the computers without this process.\n\nAlso, consider talking to an attorney -- perhaps at legal aid. A per-hour attorney is probably not going to take this case because of its low monetary value, although if you have a regular attorney, he may be willing to take it "pro bono," perhaps as training for a younger associate with his office.

It was a case of mistaken identity, according to the Israelis. It happened during the Six Day War, the IDF/AF were taking out any and all enemy ships and planes to prevent an attack on them. \n\nIsrael paid $13,000,000 in indeminties to the US and lodged a formal apology. \n\nHowever the incident is slightly shady, since the American ship did not look at all like an Arab ship, and it was also an intelligence vessel.\n\nThe reason it got covered up is obvious. One, its an intelligence vessel. The press loves finding intelligence gaps, and losing a ship like that is an embarresment to the US. Two, it could badly damage US-Israeli relations, which werent strong then but were now. That's probably why this story took so long to get out.\n\nto the other guy who answered, you are thinking of the USS Cole, which was attacked in Yemen and was not covered up. The terrorists responsible escaped from a Yemeni prison.
The only way I can think of is never to send emails with your email account and never tell anyone what your email address is. But that kind of defeats the purpose of having an email address. If you get too much, you can change to another email address and be more careful about who you give your address to. It still won't be foolproof. \n\nYou can set up spam filters in most email accounts. But the spammers are working hard to get around those too.

Beautiful Woman", denotes an attractive, self-confident "woman of size". BBWs are also the focus of a subculture with interests centered on the acceptance, support, and admiration of obese women. Exceptionally large women are called SSBBWs, with the SS standing for "super size". The term "BHM," which stands for "big handsome man," is not nearly as prevalent as the term "BBW."\n\nMen who are attracted to BBWs are known as "chubby chasers," "fat admirers," or simply "having a fat fetish." Some of these men are attracted exclusively to BBWs, while others are simply attracted to good-looking women regardless of size.\n\nThe term BBW spread rapidly via the Internet during the 1990s. Although the original meaning of BBW was restricted to attractive full-figured women, the term has largely been corrupted to refer to any full-figured or overweight woman, whether she is attractive or not.\n\nMost BBW websites are pornographic, and feature women who are barely overweight to those who are morbidly obese.\n\nBBW has many near-synonyms with varying shades of meaning. "Rubenesque" (referring to the art of Peter Paul Rubens, known for portraying full-bodied women) is probably the closest synonym. "Full figured" has a more straightforward connotations, whereas "voluptuous" and "zaftig" usually connote ripeness, sensuality, and ample bust and wide hips.\n\nAccording to http://en.wikipedia.org/

if you have a undergraduate degree - then i would say, stop wasting money and try some CADD courses in local community colleges or local school's adult programs. last time i checked some tech institute they were charging around 20-30K.

Most CADD Packages share same old features but are called differently or found in different places. \n\nAll the best
woo-hoo, it was scary there for awhile, until it turned about to just be another idiotic liberal moment:\n\nHow to take exit polls as a liberal, lesson 1.\n\n1. only ask those who voted democratic\n2. only ask those who live in democratic areas\n3. report your findings with a straight face\n\nThe funniest, was Dan Rather, though.

According to the results that were in, even if the rest of the people in Ohio who were eligible to still vote, voted for Kerry, it would still not be enough to take the lead. Flash to Dan Rather, who just would not post Ohio's results as a Bush State. hoooooo, I thought he was going to explode, man did he try to stall that. \n\nTheir giddiness made me sick to my stomach, not necessarily b/c I felt like I lost, but I was sick about the thought of Kerry as Pres. \n\nThe next best thing was going to school the next day....My college classes (completely liberal profs) some students had been ragging on Bush all semester saying how Kerry was going to crush him......wow, I made sure I showed up Nov. 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nWhy is it that people say the election is rigged when it didn't go their way? Accept it, and lets move on, as a country. \n\nAnd, furthermore, why is it, that liberals accept the decisions of the Supreme Court on an "as they like it" basis. Roe v. Wade: they love that one, but Bush v. Gore---oh my goodness, he has the justices in his pocket.....or wait, it was a more liberal court then, if anyone had them in their pocket, wouldn't it have been Gore...maybe, just maybe, Bush won fair and square......\n\nAnd if one more person blames him for hurrican katrina, I am going to scream!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know he could make wind like that. How about local government in New Orleans? What in the world were they doing? Oh wait, they are democrats, the media won't ask that question.
It is important to learn to not let the little things escalate into big ones if you plan on being married. First off, agree that fighting is a waste of time and energy. All it does is destroy what you have. Sure, you don't always agree, and often you really don't have to. Remember, being together is about compromise and that is a 50/50 thing. Don't ever let even little things fester by walking away or refusing to deal with them. Always remind each other that you love one another and acknowledge that you hear and understand what the other person is saying to you. It is a lot of work to be in a relationship but it is better to work hard for the good than to spend it fighting.

When I picked her up, she looked like an angel, We went to The cheesecake factory, had a great conversation over dinner, and we talked for almost 3 hours at the resturant, after we went to the lake and rented a boat and I rowed her around while we talked what seemed forever, after which we went to the improv comedy club and laughed over the comics. After we went to a local irish pub, had a few drinks while we watched a irish folk singer, then I dropped her off at her house after spending all day together. She told me that it was the best date she has ever had, because although we spend alot of time together in one day, it seemed like a minute, because of all the fun and the great converstion together.

Ok, so you have 500 mL of methanol. A specific gravity of .792 g/mL means there are 396 grams of methanol. Concentration (molarity) is moles per liter. So those are theu nits you want. So you take 396 grams of methanol and divide it by the molecular weight (32) to get 12.375 moles. However, that is for 500 mL or .5 L. You want 1 L. So you multiply it by 2. Your answer shoudl be 24.75 moles/liter. \n\nHope this helps and keep up the good work.

If you had to chose between the 2, I think Pete Rose should enter into the HOF. His individual accomplishments as a "pure" athlete are truly amazing. If you look at Bonds' career before he supposedly started taking steroids, he should also enter into the HOF, but not before Rose. What I don't get is people who say he didn't take steroids, or that it wasn't illegal in baseball at that time to take it. Are you kidding me??? Bonds testified under a grand-jury that he "unkowingly" took steroids. That's like saying, "I didn't know my friend was giving me pot brownies for the past 5 years." Of course you're gonna' know something's up if your body/mind has a drastic effect from something you're taking. Also, what makes baseball above the law? "Steroids weren't illegal in baseball at that time." Yes, they were. They were & are illegal in the United States.
I had a 'pouch' too, I decided I would do 100 sit ups a night, and every night add 5 more. After about 2 weeks i saw a reduction, 4 weeks and it was gone. I didn't change my diet at all, and it wasn't really THAT bad, but maybe if I had I would have seen a bigger change sooner.\n\nSo my advice to you is to follow that exercise plan, and cardio and low cal diets will only make it go faster. Although, you should know that it does vary per-person.

There are many proofs, for example via Boolean algebras or compact Hausdorff topological spaces or binary trees and probably more.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence S0, S1, S2, ..., of sets of truth assignments, such that:\n\n a) S0 is the set of all truth assignments\n b) S1 is a subset of S0, S2 is a subset of S1, S3 is a subset of S2, etc.\n c) For every finite subset E of A, every Sn contains at least one truth assignment that satisfies E\n\nNote that by assumption, S0 satisfies condition (c).\n\nEnumerate the propositional letters as p0, p1, p2, ...\n\nGiven that Sn satisfies (c), construct S{n+1} as follows:\n\n let Fn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is FALSE }\n let Tn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is TRUE }\n\nClaim: at least one of Fn and Tn must satisfy clause (c).\n\nWhy? Suppose that both E1 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Fn and E2 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Tn. Then E1 union E2 is also a finite subset of A which can be seen to have no satifying assignment in Sn, contrary to our assumption about Sn.\n\nSo now we define\n\n S{n+1} = Fn if every finite subset of A has a satisfying assignment in Fn, otherwise S{n+1} = Tn\n\nThis way we define S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ... so that all Sn have property (c) and each S{n+1} is a proper subset of Sn.\n\nThere is one truth assignment in the intersection of all of the S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, .... Why? It is the assignment that assigns FALSE to pn if S{n+1} was Fn and TRUE to pn if S{n+1} was Tn. It can be seen that both this truth assignment is in the common intersection of the Sn and that no other truth assignment can be.\n\nFinally, the one truth assignment in the common intersection of the Sn is a satifying truth assignment for all of the formulas in A. I guess the easiest way to see this is that for any finite subset E of A (including the one-element subsets), all of the letters of the formulas in E are pi for 0 <= i < n. Then since Sn already decides the FALSE or TRUE value of each pi, 0 <= i < n, we see that every truth assignment in Sn decides E the same way: all elements of Sn satify E or all elements of Sn do not satifsy E. But at least one element of Sn must satisfy E -- so they all do, including the unique truth assignment in the common intersection of all of the Sn.\n\nSo A has at least one satisfying truth assignment.\n\n(You can find others by varying whether you pick Fn or Tn as the next S{n+1} whenever both have property (c)).\n\n\nUpdate: A few hours later I realized the above was essentially the same as saying:\n\nClaim: If A is a finitely satisfiable set of formulas and s is a formula, then at least one of A union { s }, A union { not s } is also finitely satisfiable.\n\nOtherwise there are finite subsets E1 and E2 of A such that neither E1 union { s ] nor E2 union { not s } can be satisfied, when clearly the finite subset E1 union E2 of A cannot be satisfied.\n\nSo in the above construction the sequence S0, S1, S2, ... corresponded to a sequence like for example\n\n A0 = A\n A1 = A0 union { not p0 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A0 union { p0 } (which then is, by the claim)\n A2 = A1 union { not p1 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A1 union { p1 } (which then is, by the claim)\n\n...where as before the propositional letters are p0, p1, p2, ....\n\nThen the union of all of the An is finitely satisfiable (because a finite subset would be contained in some finitely satisfiable An along the way) and in fact you can read off a satisfying truth assignment of the union of all of the An because for each letter the union contains either the letter (so assign it TRUE) or its negation (so assign it FALSE).\n\nSame proof, just a different way of looking at it.

Presuming you mean real space ships operating in a zero-gravity environment and not just fake spaceships on a film set? Funkymonk is right, gentle accelleration followed by a turn-over mid trip and an equal dceleration would create a sensation of 'gravity' through the soles of the feet.\n\nAlternatively, in (say) a orbital space station, the interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces created by spinning a structure, with its occupants, about its axis much like in the opening sequences of the film 2001, will create a sensation of gravity (tricky concept, very hard to understand ... serious maths involved) . A large diameter structure spinning slowly would produce the best effect.\n\nMuscle wasting resulting from long periods in zero gravity is a major impediment to long space journeys, the gravity problem is one that needs to be resolved so that cosmonaughts can survive back in earth gravity once they return.

There is much more to a relationship than affection. Personally i love affection, but there are those that are affectionate, and they lead healthy strong relationship. The key is the connection between the two in the relationship. If one person lives for affection and the other hates it well then that's a recipe for disaster. \n\nThen on the other hand if the person feels other things are important in the relationship like kindness or emotional support or even financial support. They the relationship will be fine.. \n\nIt really boils down to the individuals in the relationship. There dozens of things that make people compatible and incompatible. Affection is just one aspect... Good luck.

Well, the US fought its own bloody civil war on the way to nationhood; perhaps it’s a right of passage democracies have to go through. Imagine if there had been a third power standing between the Yankees and the Confederates saying ‘cant you guys just all get along?’ Yea…right…. Would have gone down a treat.\n\nThe US is now no more than the meat between the two slices of bread trying to eat each other. Those who can afford to flee Iraq are doing so at a rate equivalent to 1% population per month. 1%…. that’s bad, real bad…. Do the math, civil war is inevitable and is already there, its just not yet very organised. That is changing. Blood will point the way to the future, and rather a lot of it.\n\nHow on gods earth the Americans thought they could bring democracy to Iraq is beyond me, a high school history student should have seen this coming. Power held for centuries by a 30% minority now suddenly and effectively disenfranchised from power by democracy. Who would swallow that? I know what will happen though; the US will pull out of Iraq and support the government against the anti government ‘insurgents’… which will be on a percentage of population basis more than those Americans who voted for Bush.
To touch wood or knock on wood is a superstition action to ward off any evil consequences or bad luck, perhaps because of some recent action you’ve taken or untimely boasting about your good fortune (“I’ve never been in danger of drowning, touch wood”); it can also be a charm to bring good luck.\nThe origin is unknown, though some writers have pointed to pre-Christian rituals involving the spirits of sacred trees such as the oak, ash, holly or hawthorn. There is, I’m told, an old Irish belief that you should knock on wood to let the little people know that you are thanking them for a bit of good luck. There’s also a belief that the knocking sound prevents the Devil from hearing your unwise comments. Others have sought a meaning in which the wood symbolises the timber of the cross, but this may be a Christianisation of an older ritual. It wasn’t always wood that was lucky: in older days, iron was also thought to have magical properties, and to touch iron was an equivalent preventative against ill-fortune.\nThe phrase itself is relatively modern, as the oldest citation for the British version of the phrase, touch wood, that I can find dates only from 1899. The American equivalent knock on wood is roughly contemporary, with my first example from 1905.

I've wondered this myself, after being annoyed seeing polar bears and penguins together on a TV advertisement. As mentioned in previous posts, penguins would only be a seasonally-available food supply, although a good one when present. There are however, six species of seals in antarctic waters, at least one of them (Weddell Seals) maintain breathing holes in the ice throughout the southern winter. They have no experience with land predators, and with the amazing seal-hunting skills of the polar bear, they would be easy prey. I decided that polar bears just may have a chance surviving in the antarctic. Let's not try to find out though, as their presence would be devastating for the species mentioned above and the antarctic ecosystem as a whole. Fun to ponder though!

"Flash Card Baseball". Make up flash cards with the vocabulary words (Spanish on one side and English on the other). Simple words are a "single". More difficult words are a "double". Since triples are rare, a few very difficult words would earn a "triple". The extremely difficult words would be a "home run". Missed words would be an "out".\n\nDivide the class into two teams. First one team is "up". Either a member of the opposing team or you is the pitcher and shows the word (flash card). Keep track of the score. When a student correctly identifies a word, she or he actually goes over to the "correct base"; the students actually move around the classroom to the correct base, some of them eventually score.\n\nYou can make your own rule modifications to fit your class. Students will be rooting for their team mates. This will be fun, educational and promote student morale. I suggest that each time you do this exercise, that you mix up the the students so that the same students will not always be on the team with the most "runs".\n\nGood luck.

You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes. \n\nIn the instructions at Grants.gov, you have to first go to CFDA to find out the grant number that you qualify. You can search CFDA various ways (by grant number, by keyword, etc.). You can find grant programs by category -- here are the lists of grants under Home Buying/Homeownership http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.FIND_GRANT_PROGRAM_TXT.SHOW?p_arg_names=func_cat_cd&p_arg_values=ML Check if any applies to you\n\nTo make searching easier, Housing and Urban Development HUD has a list of housing grants http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/grants/fundsavail.cfm - though I have NOT seen any grants available for first time homeowners.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html

You probably have quite a find there. Clemens pitched only briefly with the New Britain Rock Cats in 1983 before being called up to Pawtucket in AAA. Collectibles are only worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them. If you wait until he gets elected to the Hall of Fame the value will probably be greater.
Depends on your goals in life! I have two degrees from UCI - biology and chemistry. I can't really comment on UCI now, because I earned my degrees there in the 70's. Ooh, I'm feeling old!\n\nAt that time, the biology and chemistry programs were very good and have served me well (I am a retired Chiropractor and spend my days doing research on nutritional biochemistry and molecular medicine.)\n\nI don't think the real issue is 'which school'. It is much more important to pursue your passions in life. If you are not sure what your passions are (at your age that is common), then spend a little time exploring them. You might consider attending which ever school offers both fields of study. You can take classes in both subjects until you 'find your passion' (it might even be in something totally different!).\n\nBest wishes and good luck.
No, the swirling is caused by the direction that the water is shot into the basin. It can be either clock-wise or counter clock-wise in either hemisphere. The Coriolis effect does not come into play; it depends on how the toilet is designed. In many toilets outside the U.S., the water is not shot in a swirling motion and no noticeable Coriolis swirling occurs.

First of all dating someone who has been your froiend is tough. As for how to let him down and still be friends....Dealing with heartbreak allways hurts someone and is very difficult to do, but if you do not be honest with him now...it will go on and on and the next thing you know..he will hear it from someone else and all of a sudden you are using him...at least that is what he will think. Just be upfront and honest with him. This way he knows the truth before someone else can distort it.\n\n\n\nCB

A person's name, regardless of the position in a sentence, is always capitalized as a sign of importance to that person. The same with "I" when speaking of yourself. \n\nOn a regular basis no one speaks in third person narrative (use your own name when speaking of yourself) therefore "I" is capitalized. Essentially you are still speaking of yourself but in a different narrative which is just as deserving as using your own or someone elses name.\n\nHe, she and it are not capitalized (in the middle of a sentence)because those terms specifically do not refer to one person all on their own. They need to be supported then you know who he, she and it are. \nEx. Billy was walking in the park and he found a ball. \nIf I had said "He was walking in the park and found a ball" you wouldn't know who "he" was. \n\nI believe people do capitalize "He" or "She" when referring to a Deity to show their up most respect but it's not necessary or required.
Well, number one, succefully is actually spelled wrong. Look it up in the dictionary. So your influence with the HIPHOP culture must be taking root well. Besides violence and rape, women are being called prostitutes - basically by you and your buds. So this question is something an idiot would ask.\nWhy don't you TRY to get an education and do something good for the world instead of demeaning women. HIPHOP is KILLING America. You're a prime example.
Does your husband suffer with allergies? It could be a reaction to something he came in contact with. Does he rub the eye a good bit? It may be caused by something he was working with and by rubbing his eye he may have accidentally rubbed something in it. Does his eye burn or water at all? If his eye problem does not go away in the next day, tell him he should see a eye doctor. It could be more serious than allergies. Eye sight is a precious gift we all have. If the problem persists, he should get it looked at and taken care of ASAP. Good luck!

The idea was the egg shells absorbed the acid as well as bad odors and tastes.\nI think it would make a mess if you add just the whites to the hot coffee. ???
Well basically the healthiest way to lose weight, is to limit your food intake and exercise at least 30 min. a day.\n\nWeight watchers is good program, because you can basically eat what you want but it just limits your food portions. \n\nAlso you should maybe join a gym or join a group exercise program, that will get you motivated. If you can't do that. Walk or jog in the park or in your neighborhood.\n\nJust remember, you need good will power and the commitment to want to loose weight.\n\nGood Luck!

terrorism is a point of view.. does that make it right? of course not.. but if you truly believe there was an evil nation that was going to destroy the world and you knew no other nation could stand up to it toe to toe, how would you fight back? from their mentality i can understand why they are terrorists even if i completely disagree with that mentality and their cause... and understanding that is why i say the War on Terror can only be won threw changing people minds in ways other than force.. sure sometimes force is necessary.. but to use it all the time just makes them believe more strongly in their cause.. at some point diplomacy has to resume and a mental war has to be waged.

I think it is pathetic, there is no need to abuse anyone or anything, yes we all get angry and maybe say things we regret but if we realize our faults thats a start to maybe containing a little if not all the selfcontrol we have.

well you have to question your self what am i doing? Are you pouring your feelings out to them? are you just that cool girl they like to kick it with? How do i look when i am around them?

What's up JC? A pusher is my personal worst enemy on the court. There's nothing that I hate more than showing up for a match and finding out that the guy on the other side of the net is a pusher. I'm a power player--big serve, big groundies, hit my opponent off the court---but pushers are really our worst nightmare in general.\n\nIt's best to discuss what makes pushers so difficult. If we can pinpoint those reasons, then we can better attack them.\n\n1. Pushers capitalize off their opponents' weaknesses--off of their mistakes. A previous poster mentioned that they exist everywhere, but she would also admit, I'm sure, that they are more numerous in recreational tennis than in D1 and professional tennis. This is because as players move up in skill levels, they make fewer and fewer dumb mistakes--i.e., pushers have fewer and fewer chances to make their free points.\n\n2. Pushers are able to "get one more ball back". It goes without saying that the player who returns more "last balls" is going to be the one who wins.\n\n3. Pushers aren't the ones who feel the pressure. More likely than not, pushers are the weaker of the two players on the court. In this situation, it's obviously the stronger player who tells himself/herself, "Okay, you can beat this moonballer..." And then as soon as you start making mistakes you get down on yourself, "C'mon! This kid sucks! You should beat him left-handed! You must really suck." Etc.\n\n4. Pushers don't care about pace. This is what I hate the most. When I am the one who has to provide the power and the pace to my shots, I start making more errors. However, my pace doesn't cause too many problems to the pusher because all he has to do is block my shot back.\n\nI suppose that there are a few other reasons that could be examined, but these four are the ones that cause so much trouble for me. Now, let's try and break down each one to figure out how to use it agains them.\n\n1. A pusher wants me to make mistakes. Pushers want us to go for "too much", or as a former coach always used to say, "To go for 21 when our opponent had 13". You're going to want to make sure that your shots have good clearance over the net and that you apply a good amount of topspin. Pushers aren't going to punish you for short balls, and so don't worry about keeping things deep. If anything, the short balls will make things difficult for them as they'll be forced to adjust (as was mentioned by a previous poster who talked about drop shots).\n\n2. If the pusher's goal is to get one more ball back than you, then you're going to make them earn it. I like to work them hard. If they think that all they're going to have to do to beat me is to run down my shots for three strokes before I make a mistake, I make a point of showing them otherwise. I hit a lot of high-percentage shots to the corners (remember, the distance from corner to corner--or even from the middle to the corner--is much longer--and therefore a harder shot to miss long--than going down the line) and make them run. Mix things up. Make them take a few steps into no-man's land and then make them move backwards. Drop shots are difficult shots to hit on a high-percentage basis, but if you can do it well, then pull that out (I can't, so I don't use it too much...unless I feel REALLY inspired).\n\n3. Make the pushers feel the pressure. They read things on your face and in your body language. If you're upbeat and bouncing around and positive, they're not going to gain any confidence from your frustration. Plus, if you're making them run and getting back a lot of shots and making them pay for hitting the ball back to the middle, then they'll start feeling the pressure. This one is mostly mental. Don't get frustrated.\n\n4. Don't worry about hitting the fuzz off the ball. The best thing to do is to work your

I think she has a really good chance at winning more grand slams since nobody has been dominating tennis on the women's side. It would be great if she wins the French Open, the only grand slam she has yet to win. She just needs time to adjust a bit better to tennis, and once she does, she is going to be unstoplable. She is only 26 (not 28), so she is very young.

no that was a rumour which was denied by el arabeya channel after 3 days from the rumoir this is the latest news they denied this on 17 october and also didnot u watch the chat with kaka on acmilan.com 26 october??? (see question 2 and 30)they asked him about his rituals before matches he said i read the bible and they asked him about his motto he said i is i belong to jesus and about his fave music he said it is gospel that was a week ago also he denied this rumour in italian soursec and said that he will always be an evangelist christian iam really surprised that this rumour is still going on even after the chat with kaka last week where he proved to be a very devout evangelist christian without even asking him about his religion and to believe me i sent u the links which proves everything here is the translation of some questions in the chat from rickykaka.com and here is the link of the chat from acmilan.com but translate it from italian and u have to be registered there and here is the denial of the rumour from arbiya channel site which was one of the sources that spread the rumour even most arabic soccer forums denied this rumout later\nwhat is this tourist ???? do u think that when someone makes a seach about a character and the word muslim appears this means that he annonced it???this word only appears beside his name in yahoo search because there were millions of fans searching this on the net when the rumour went on 3 weeks ago and the arabic source denied it translate it from arabic from google if u donot understand arabic!!\nhey denise i think that i gave u the proof that noone can doubt from acmilan official site and from arabic sites what else do u want to get to believe that it is just a rumour?for god's sake how can a religious man change his relgion during a visit which lasted for 2 days only??there is not even a single official source for this rumour that is why el arabeya channel denied it 3 days later

FTP is commonly run on two ports, 20 and 21, and runs exclusively over TCP. The FTP server listens on port 21 for incoming connection from FTP clients. A connection on this port forms the control stream, on which commands are passed to the FTP server. For the actual file transfer to take place, a different connection is required. Depending on the transfer mode, the client (active mode) or the server (passive mode) can listen for the incoming data connection. Before file transfer begins, the client and server also negotiate the port of the data connection. In case of active connections (where the server connects to the client to transfer data), the server binds on port 20 before connecting to the client. For passive connections, there is no such restriction.

In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids, and gases because of its unique properties. "Ionized" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\n\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter")]. The nature of the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897], and dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 ], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma]. Langmuir wrote:\n\n"Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons."\nPlasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas). [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely.

talk to your doctor about a healthy plan for you, but please, don't obsess over this, just eat healthy foods and get exercise (play a sport, swim, walk the dog everyday, participate in gym class, etc.). drink plenty of water, try replacing unhealthy snacks (potato chips, chocolate bars) with better ones (carrots, bananas, yogurt, an egg, wheat crackers, you get the idea). if you are obese, your doctor should tell you how to safely get to a healthy weight. if you are just trying to lose a few pounds, relax, your body is okay, after puberty, if you continue to have a healthy lifestyle, your body will look better (a little fat is common, and even good, so don't worry). if you are concerned about your weight, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist. and whatever you do, don't starve yourself, force yourself to vomit, use laxatives to lose weight, etc. it's very unhealthy and can kill you.\nGood luck, and stay healthy!

If your looking for a group, weight watchers is the way to go, but if you want to do it on your own you have to change your lifestyle for life. Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fresh (not canned that’s bad) fruits and vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart. You also need to stay away from any sports drinks unless you’ve just had a long workout and then you need to limit yourself. Most atheletes mix Gatorade with water because its two complex for your body to get all the nutrients out of. It needs to be diluted. These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without. Then work from there. Remember these are perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it. If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day. Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit. Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night. You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly. This is an important factor of losing weight. Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night. \nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me. Also for more info on the benefits of water go to www.watercure.com Good Luck! Honestly if you need anything else don't hesitate to IM me, krista_girl86 even if you don't pick me as best answer, i'd be happy to help.

The coriolis force is just a fictitious force that comes from trying to describe a rotating noninertial frame as an inertial frame (the centrifugal force is another one). Anytime there is a rotating noninertial frame, the motion can be more easily analyzed using the coriolis paradigm. And of course, the universe is FULL of rotating noninertial frames; planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, etc.

THE HISTORIES\nCornelius Tacitus, \nRoman Historian, 55-A.D\n\n"Some say that the Israelites were fugitives from the island of Crete, who settled on the nearest coast of Africa about the time when Saturn was driven from his throne by the power of Jupiter. Others assert that in the reign of Isis the overflowing population of Egypt, led by Hierosolymus and Judas, discharged itself into the neighboring countries. Many, again, say that they were a race of Ethiopian origin, who in the time of king Cepheus were driven by fear and hatred of their neighbors to seek a new dwelling-place." \n\n The Muslims said "they were living in great number to the south of the desert - a people cursed of God and predestines as slaves." The Muslims also called the western Sudan (West Africa) "Yahoodee" which means "The Tribes of Israel". \n In another article By George E. Lichtblau entitled \n"Jewish Roots in Africa", he gives a details about the Hebrews in west Africa. \n\n"Claims of a historic presence of Jewish communities in certain regions of Africa, notably West and Southern Africa, seem esoteric when first mentioned. This presence goes back not just centuries, but even to biblical times." \n\n "the first place, many Hebrewisms were discovered in the Ashanti tribal customs. Then several Ashanti words were found to have a striking resemblance to those of equivalent Hebrew meaning. Finally, the Supreme Being of the Ashanti gave strong indication of being the Yahweh of the Old Testament. It was indeed surprising how many Hebrewisms, either real or at least apparent, were to be found among the unislamised tribes."\n\nTaken from the book Hebrewisms of West Africa, by Joseph J. Williams \n(copy written in the 1930's) Pages 22 & 23

Forensic Scientist ($22,000-35,000)\n\nJob Description\nForensic scientists collect and analyze evidence found at crime scenes. Specifically, they analyze blood, saliva, semen, drugs, fingerprints, and firearms and perform reconstructions on skeletal bones. Forensic scientists also confer with law enforcement personnel and attorneys on evidence collection, preserve evidence, write reports, and testify in court. The scientific analysis of evidence often proves critical in determining the innocence or guilt of a person accused of a crime. Thus, forensic scientists play a vital role in the criminal justice process.\n\nEducation\nEntry-level jobs in forensic science require a four-year degree in one of the following: biology, chemistry, physics, microbiology, genetics, or medical technology. Communication arts and law classes are considered helpful. Some crime labs also require laboratory experience.\n\nSpecial Skills\nA forensic scientist works with many different kinds of people, often under stressful circumstances. Thus, it is essential for a person in this field to have good "people" skills. Because forensic scientists must complete many reports and make court appearances, they must be capable writers and good speakers. Finally, forensic scientists must be able to manipulate tiny bits of evidence under a microscope that requires excellent hand-eye coordination.\n\nSalary and Benefits\nForensic scientists generally work for state or federal crime laboratories. Because these positions are found primarily in government, some medical and retirement benefits are paid.\nAt the state level, beginning forensic scientists are paid about $1,900 per month. Those who start with laboratory experience may receive as much as $3,000 per month. Depending on the state, experienced workers may eventually earn between $35,000 and $50,000 per year. Federal salaries are usually higher.\n\nWorking Conditions\nAs employees of the government, forensic scientists generally work 40-hour weeks. However, because of increasing caseloads and the need to meet deadlines, they may work extra hours.\nForensic scientists work primarily in the crime lab. However, they also go to the scene of the crime to examine and secure evidence, and they testify in court.\n\nOutlook\nGood forensic scientists are always in demand. However, because of pressures to reduce government funding, beginning positions are usually limited, and competition for them is keen. The job outlook in this area is, at best, fair.\n\nFor More Information\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\nP.O. Box 669\n410 North 21st St., Suite 203\nColorado Springs, CO 80901

Have you asked her about her not talking to you?\n\nMaybe you should give it some time, maybe a few weeks, and try talking to her about it. Ask her what's wrong and why she doesn't want to talk to you about it. \n\nI think, maybe, if you keep trying and things don't improve, you might consider breaking up with her. But who knows, maybe she's ashamed or something and doesn't want to tell you? It's hard to say when you don't know what's wrong with her and how she's feeling about whatever it is.\n\nI say keep trying, but don't be too pushy, and think about it some before you make your final choice.

Not in this household, and it would be better by far to purchase some commercial lube. Glycerin will produce a burning sensation, and honey, by providing glucose to feed the candida yeast organism that is naturally present on humans, may cause a person to develop a yeast infection. Honey is also sticky, not slippery, so it would be counterproductive in other ways.
The first World cup was in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1930 at the Centenario Stadium. Uruguay became the first inagural champions - they beat Argentina 4-2. This is all I knew about the first World Cup. I looked it up on the internet and there is a VERY interesting description on Wikipedia and so much more information about the matches. There is only 1 player alive today that played in the 1930 final match!

I've never been to college, didn't even finish high school, but I can tell you it is Personal Bias, Political Bias, Commercial (or money inspired) Bias. \n\nThe media outlets all must have a positive profit model in order to stay in operation, this means there is quite a bit of external influence as to what is reported and what is left out, and this influence even extends to how the information which they do report is worded. \n\nIgnorance is a factor that plagues the internet and some news outlets. It's difficult to know what factors could be influencing an anonymous person to make claims. Their health, their experiences, their likes and dislikes, what they intend to achieve with the claim, all have influence.\n\nProduct manufacturers, or any publicly traded company can be held financially liable if they don't do everything within the law to garner the greatest margins of profit for their business. This encourages advertisement to be rife with misleading images, words and even subliminally suggested intentions. Money is a huge factor that influences all advertisement claims. \n\nI have to note that each of the fields you mentioned have their own specific influencing factors, and it's difficult to generalize them across the whole lot. For instance, a movie's claims are often motivated by the writer or directors specific intentions of how they wish to influence people with the work. You aren't likely to see this as much in say.. news reporting.
I don't think so.\n\nFor one thing, even if one could transfer the genetic materials correctly, there is no way a human could have the "proportional strength of a spider" or ant or anything like that. The physical nature of muscules will not scale up like that. The strongest one could get is, well, as strong as the strongest human, whoever that is.\n\nThe web material seems fictional as well. For one thing, what sort of glad (or tiny device) could generate so much material without either (1) lots of refills, (2) a huge tank.

ABSOLUTLEY!\n\nSleep performs a restorative function for the brain and body as evidenced by the myriad symptoms of metabolic dysfunction that result when animals are deprived of sleep.\n\nTherefore, by not getting enough sleep, you are not providing your body with the neccesary "refresh" stage that builds hormones and chemicals needed to keep your energy high enough to lose weight. Lack of sleep puts your body into a different "mode" and you will have less energy, and feel less like eating right and excersizing. You might think you would be able to tell yourself you can fight that, but you cannot.\n\nSleeping also is where your mind takes your short term memory and places into long term. So, lack of sleep makes you forget things more, and your body reverts to "insticts". \n\nOur instincts aren't that healthy for us sometimes... for example, your brain will ask for more junk food as it makes you feel "comfortable" and your brain will ask for more relaxing time, even without sleep.\n\nTrust me, you will not lose weight without proper rest, and lack of sleep will only help you GAIN weight, and stress your system!
Dear friend, a man named JOB asked the same question, a very long time ago. This man had a perfect life,a beautiful family and lots of sheep (wealth). However, JOB was selected by GOD to be tested by SATAN to see if he could endure the woes,\nand sorrows of losing his own family,his livestock and everything that he owned. So when this happened ,JOB was very bitter and sad becuse he thought he was cursed by GOD himself. However, has time passed GOD spoke to JOB in the form of a whirlwind and JOB finally saw just how special he was in GOD's eye after GOD demanded a plea from JOB.\nYou see, GOD demands respect from us but above all,\nGOD does'nt want us to be PRIDEFUL idiots. My fiend you are not the worst person in the entire world, you are my own flesh and blood pleading for justice.

Some species of the Whiptail Lizard reproducing without having sex - not completely unusual in nature, but it is for more complex vertebrates. All of the lizards are females and courtship IS still required - pairs are formed, one playing the role of the male, the other female, even though no copulation takes place. Then they switch places. Baby lizards are born through a process known as 'virgin birth'. I think that is pretty interesting - and whoever said homosexuality is not natural??

You have to decide how much you really love or want to be with the new guy you are with because it is not fair to him. It is ok to stay in touch with your ex's as friends but if you are accepting gifts and talking to him all the time then that does not sound like a friendship thing. I stay in touch with all my ex's but I only talk to them once in a while I certainly would not accept gifts from them. My suggestion is for you to sit down and put yourself in you soon to be husbands shoes and see if you would honestly be ok with him doing that to you. As far as your kids liking your old guy better there is nothing you can do about that but if you are really going to get married to this guy the kids have got to develop a relationship with the new guy. \nHope the advice helps all I can say is treat your soon to be husband with the respect and love you expect from him.
Mine happened in Jr. High. I was talking to the girl behind me and the teacher called me up to his desk. He said that for talking I was to get paddled. (Then it was allowed.) He gave me one wack, and then asked the kids in the back of the class if they heard it. When they said "No", he gave me another wack. He asked if they heard that one, and the answer again was "No". So he gave me a third wack, only harder. When the back of the class said that they heard that one, he stopped. I told my mother what happened,and she said that I should not have been talking in class.

To determine the mass percent of Ca in Ca(CN)2 all you have to do is find the mass of Ca, divide it by the total mass of Ca(CN)2, then multiply by 100. \n\nTherefore:\n\nmass of Ca = 40.08 amu (or g/mol)\nmass of Ca(CN)2 = 92.10 amu (or g/mol)\n\n(40.08 amu / 92.10 amu) x 100 = 43.52% Ca in Ca(CN)2
No, you cannot have 24 pairs of chromosomes even with mutations. Having XXXX does not give you 24 pairs of chromosomes; you still have 23 pairs with 4 chromosomes in pair #23. Your total number of chromosomes increases in that case to 48 instead of the normal number 46.\nMutations will either add or decrease the total number of chromosomes by either adding or deleting a chromosome to one pair. Notice that more than one chromosome could be added to a pair.\nDown's syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome to pair #21, resulting in 47 chromosomes with of course 23 pairs. Klinefelter's results in an extra X with also 23 pairs. The individual has 47 chromosomes; the 23rd pair or sex chromosomes is XXY.

OVERVIEW for 2007: \nPisces is having a once in a lifetime opportunity for great changes this year. You will be having the time of your life, expressing your loving and compassion to the world and fulfilling your boldest dreams. There won't be a dull moment and you will intuitively know exactly what path to follow and what feels right in your heart. You will feel compelled to grasp new opportunities that manifest self-transformation in your career. You're stepping into your power easily, especially around April when you are urged to express your visionary mentality. You might rediscover your musical abilities and express yourself in creative ways. You have the power and inspiration to bring mystical sensitivity to what's around you. It's time to bring out the dreamy, loving and compassionate side of yourself and let it shine. You may want to get involved in writing, be it lyrics, poetry or just self reflection. Your idealistic nature is inspired from a strong connection to your surroundings, and you easily express yourself from a place of inner awareness. Your natural ability to communicate ideas to others is keenly perceptive now. Focus on trusting your intuition and you will get through nearly any circumstance. You need to lighten up about difficulties in life. Don't be so critical and overly concerned about details. Because you're so sensitive to others' moods, you may feel like you're not coming across in a very positive way. Take time out and have fun this year. Embrace that intimate love relationship you have!\n\nSample Numerology reading \nMarch 10, 1980\n\nThis Year: 3\nSelf-expression and optimism fill your moments now. The waiting period is over and it's time to jump up and get on with things. Luck is on your side, and you seem to shine with sunny warmth and enthusiasm which draws well-wishers, (and potential benefactors), to you from near and far. Creative pursuits, travel, and communication of every kind is emphasized now. This time can bring an actual "birth", or a figurative one in the form of a new business or career, a work of art or even a new self-image. The important thing is that you use this time of opportunity to the best of your advantage and find new ways to express who you are.\n\nPersonal Day: 3\nSing, dance, make people laugh! Wear yellow or orange. Today you radiate and warm like the sun. Smile and bless us all!\n\nLife Path or Destiny: 22\nThe Destiny number describes the life lessons that we have come here to learn. It reveals to us the path we must take, and the role we must play to fulfill our mission. Often our choice of career is based on this vibration, and if not, then it will manifest through avocational pursuits. We may attract people and experiences into our lives that mirror the traits of this number for us, so that we may develop into our highest potential. We don't always welcome our life lessons, so it is a possibility that we may even feel an aversion to the characteristics of our Destiny number in other people, and we may ourselves act the opposite. In spite of the many ways we may choose to react to this force within us, we have been gifted with all of the talents and energy needed to fulfill our Destiny. This "master number" requires the bearer to dedicate their life to philanthropic aims and service on a world-wide scale. Your destiny gives you the potential to accrue vast wealth, power and greatness through inspired and constructive reformation of social standards. No matter what form your fortune takes, it will be important that it benefits large groups of people in some way. Number 22 is a higher octave of the number 4 and may be experienced as such, or fluctuate during your lifetime.\n\nCycles\nThe destiny is divided into 3 great cycles, each governing us for specific durations throughout our life. The Seed cycle begins at birth and colors our experiences through childhood and adolescence. During the year nearest our

It is called Bernoulli's principle. As velocty of a fluid increases, the pressure decreases. Think of a traffic jam. As the traffic gets slower, the cars are very close together, but after the site of the accident, the cars speed up and the distance between them is very great. Fluid molecules are the same, high pressure is an area of high density among particles, they're close together. Low pressure is an area of relative low density, more space between particles. It's the same principle that allows airplanes to fly.

My national league favorite is the Cubs. Probably because they have such a similar history to my real favorite, the Red Sox. I'm a fanatic and either watch the games on TV with the MLB package because I live in Florida, or XM radio, and even sink to watching the play by play on "Gameday". I don't think I've missed a pitch in 3 years. Oh, yeah, I go to St. Petersburg whenever they come to play the Devil Rays.\n\nBut, I'd love to see the Cubs win the world series. With the way things are going the past few years it's only right. Better yet, play the Red Sox in the world series. They can win that one if they promise to go 7 games, but if they end up playing the Yankees I want the Cubs to sweep with a 4 game shutout.

Sure, just look at a frozen lake - you can usually see frozen bubbles in there. The top layer of water almost always freezes first. Any air in the water (or released into the water) naturally rises and is trapped under the top frozen layer. When the water under the top layer freezes, you have frozen bubbles. Look in your ice cube tray - you might just find some frozen bubbles there!

First, know what you want to do. Nothing else will work without the answer to that question.\n\nThen, try to figure out which employers in your area (or where ever you want to live) pay people to do what you want to do.\n\nA quick and easy way to get an idea of who would be hiring would be to go to Indeed.com (http://www.indeed.com) and do a search on the job title and location you want. That will show you the employers who have jobs open right now.\n\nApply to the employers who have jobs open now, but DON'T STOP THERE.\n\nCheck your local Yellow Pages both the print and the online versions (see http://www.superpages.com for the online Yellow Pages), to find other similar employers.\n\nIt works like this: For example, if you want to fix cars, check Indeed.com for "auto mechanic" and your Zip Code. You'll find several jobs posted from local companies (car dealers, car rental companies, limo services, etc.), and you can apply for those online. Then, you check your Yellow Pages to see what OTHER car dealers, car rental companies, limo services, etc. you can find that didn't have jobs posted.\n\nThen, contact those other employers directly to see if they have any jon openings.\n\nAND, follow-up with both the online and the off-line job applications to see keep your job search alive and your application in the mind of the person who's filling the job.\n\nGreat sources of job leads:\n\n* Indeed.com - http://www.indeed.com\nAggregates job postings from several sources including Monster and CareerBuilder as well as employer Websites\n\n* JobCentral.com - http://www.jobcentral.com\nHas job postings from 200 of the biggest companies in the U.S. as well as many smaller companies. It's run by the employers, and you apply for the jobs on the employer's Website.\n\n* Job-Hunt.org - http://www.job-hunt.org\nHas over 7,000 links to employer Websites (by state) and to other career resources, like the state employment offices (by state), colleges and universities, state and local government, federal government, etc. It also has excellent articles about protecting your privacy, creating an Internet Resume, and bunch of other great information.

My least favorite is at work. The rule is: no cell phones in patient care areas, but as soon as authority figures are out of sight the phones come out. We at work occasionally carry a cell, provided by the hospital, when there is a situation with a patient that requires us to be immediately available. The visitors automatically decide that it is my personal phone, and are mouthing off about it, when I am trying to hear how my patient is doing. \nSo here is an opportunity. People, more and more hospitals require patient care staff to carry a cell phone that is provided by the hospital, so that patients, doctors, other departments, and staff can be in immediate touch with the nurse. The hallways are long in a hospital, and often, the nurse is far away from the desk . It is for the patients safety that we do this. And you can tell when it is a hospital phone, they are usually clearly marked. Get used to it.\nBut, some people have set themselves up, out in the community, as the cell phone cops. If one rings, no matter where, they have something to say about it. I was outside, heading for an entrance into a shopping mall, I was on the sidewalk, and my cell phone rang. I never, ever, have it on, it is for emergencies, and for the convenience of a my friends, in certain situations. It was my friend, telling me she will be late, as I had already figured out, since she was not at our meeting place. Some people clear across the entrance, stopped, and had several things to say about it. They were louder, and caused more distraction then I did with my cell.People going in and out of the mall were ignoring them, or laughing at them.Thanks for asking this question.

Ethically you cannot tell him unless it is a business relationship you are looking for (eg he's a dr. you are a nurse)... \n\nIf you are looking for any other type of relationship (ie friendship or more) you will have to wait until he has been released and then have some time pass (at least a few months) before you can give him the message...

the closest thing that i can think of is leather pride. It is either that or: The black-medium blue-black flag is actually a police mourning band. It is typically worn as a band across the badge when an officer is killed in the line of duty. I have seen it in use more frequently now as a bumper sticker, I believe this is probably a show of respect for the police officers killed on September 11th.

You have to start at the very beginning: Private Property.\n\nThe more property in private hands, the more stability. People take their property and exchange with one another; forming a marketplace. \n\nThis exchange creates Prices.\n\nPrices give us the VERY valuable indicators of Profits & Losses.\n\nProfits and Losses tell us WHERE our Earth's scarce resources should be applied.\n\nFor example, high profits tell property owners "Invest your resources here...this is where the demand is."\n\nAt the same time, losses tell property owners "Remove your scarce resources from this area and apply them where they are in higher demand."\n\nA smooth, efficient marketplace, creates stability. There is no reason to fight or go to war...instead we trade. \n\nIt all begins with private property.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, you have Socialism, where the government owns all of the property. In other words, there is only one property owner.\n\nUnder such a system, you do not have trade (since one property owner cannot trade with itself).\n\nWithout trade, you do not have prices.\n\nWithout prices, you do not have profits or losses.\n\nUnder such circumstances, there is no rational way to know where our Earth's scarce resources should be applied. It's all done by political whim.\n\nThus, you have corruption, instability, and a huge tendency to go to war.\n\nIt all starts with Private Property.
No. That is not permitted by FIFA.

I think the hope is that Iran will implode and the tyrannical, hate mongering government of today will fall to either a coup, forcible revolution or economic disaster before military intervention is necessary.\n\nThe parallels to the doctrine of appeasement of Hitler's regime are indeed frightening. As is the total disregard for the genocide in Sudan. It is sad the developed world has not yet found its moral compass when it comes to human rights.

Because just anyone can get a hold of one. I think the US should make a new gun law that makes people who want to own a gun take saftey classes before they can own one. Its also in the media espcially in music. In "rap" music singers portrait gun violence and killing people cool. I think people who pass saftey classes and police interviews are the only ones who should be eligable for gun ownership.

Peace in this world is not a matter of everyone believing the same things. It's a matter of accepting the fact that everyone thinks differently, and not trying to prove who is right and who is wrong. The reason why there is not peace in the world today, is because there are too many people who can't accept the differences of others.
The longest time a man has lasted for me would be about 20 minutes, although the majority is like 10 minutes. That's just for the actual intercourse. I would like it longer, but some just go again and I am happy with that.

First off, Hitler may have won over seas, but they would have never taken the US. Even if he had won WWII he would have been overthrown quickly afterwards, there is no way the other countries of Europe would have lived under Hitler rule. So basicly the end result would have been the same, but it may have taken longer.\n\nGermany and Japan coming to the states is another non factor. The outcome would be the same there as well. You can never win a war against free men and women. What we lack in military might, we gain in creativity, and knowledge we gained as free people. Every last man and women in the US would fight until their death if it came down to losing our freedom.\n\nThe only way we lose a war is if we are nuked off the face of the earth.

Common causes for abdominal bloating are:\n\nOvereating (gastric distension) \nLactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and other food intolerances \nFood allergy \nAerophagia (air swallowing, a nervous habit) \nAlvarez' syndrome, hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without excess of gas in the digestive tract \nIrritable bowel syndrome \nPartial bowel obstruction \nGastric dumping syndrome or rapid gastric emptying \nThe ingestion of some gas-producing foods \nConstipation \nSplenic-flexure syndrome \nMenstruation, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual stress syndrome \nPolycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian cysts \nMassive infestation with intestinal parasites, such as worms (e.g, Ascaris lumbricoides) \nDiverticulosis \nImportant but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include large intra-abdominal tumors, such as those arising from ovarian, liver, uterus and stomach cancer; and megacolon, an abnormal dilation of the colon, due to some diseases, such as Chagas disease, a parasitic infection.\n\nGaseous bloating may be a consequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insuflation of air.\n\nPostmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.\n\nIn some animals, like cats, dogs and cattle, gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.

The word "latent" means "hidden". Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state.
The Fed. Govt is not allowed to have ANY form of registration for guns and gun owners, thank goodness and thank the NRA. However, F*cked up states like CA and NY do require registration IF you are EVEN allowed to purchase a firearm. \nYou did not specify what state you are in, so it is difficult to answer your question of whether or not you can purchase a firearm in another state and keep it in another, you need to edit your question and be specific.\n I do, however, understand your plight. I'm from CA and when I returned from my enlistment, I was infuriated I could not purchase a firearm with out waiting for weeks for a 'cool down' period and paying outrageous fees. So I got a job where I was allowed to carry a gun and used that everywhere I went. But it's hard to go around irrational laws this way so not everyone can do this. I also understand the concern of having to register your guns with ANYONE. People like some of the other answerer's immediately think you are up to no good when you wanna PURCHASE a firearm but forget that personal protection is not guaranteed by the police, only yourself. \nYou can purchase a firearm in a surrounding state like Arizona and even 'open' carry it without a permit in THAT state, but you have to list a residential address in that state and you cannot transport the firearm back to CA, where I THINK you are from, without listing it in that state,(CA). I can be of more help if you are more specific in your state.
Do you feel that getting you IN will be impossible or that the work will be impossible? Or, do you just not want to go to college? \n\nIf you are thinking that getting IN is impossible, but don't want to dampen your dad's enthusiasm, then encourage your dad to keep trying. Perhaps he can get you there, with connections and a checkbook, despite you being "a pretty good student." If he can, then, YAY! for him AND for you! That will,guarantee you a fabulous life, if you want it. At that point, you will go and take your basics. They will be ,relatively, the same basics that other major U's offer, and you will be capable of handling the beginning work, while getting used to college life. \n\nJust put in your aps, get references, and do the best you can do to get there. If they say no, then, they say no, and you tried. But, just in case, have back up U's, like Penn State or something (they take everyone). (joking). If money is an issue (because you have to pay for each ap, just explain to your father you are giving yourself a safety net--that you would rather not waste time if the others won't let you in. Hopefully, since he is so adamant about a good education, he will understand that any place is a better place than no place. \n\nIf you are afraid that you are not ready for college or that you are not college material, (and you might be 100% correct), suck it up, and give your dad's way a try for a semester. The worst that could happen is you fail. Big deal! I have had students fail that have gone on to manage stores and make more money than I do teaching! College is not for everyone. Still, you need to find out. You may say it is not for you, but you haven't tried it yet. You may just find out that while you were just a "pretty good" student in high school, you RULE in the world of higher education, \n\nYou cannot get anything in this world unless you ask for it and take it. You cannot have an exciting life, unless you try a little bit of everything. You won't know if you can or you can't until you do. Good Luck to you!

There are many reasons why you cannot access your e-mail account, although I have noticed that Yahoo will randomly take accounts off line for anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, especially if they see that there isn't very much activity on those accounts.\n\nPerhaps they do this if they're uploading new ads, or if one of their servers is having some problems. They have been known to disable certain accounts for awhile, although they usually put those accounts back on line within 3 weeks or thereabouts. Of course, they're certainly not going to admit to doing this, as you could imagine the number of complaints they would receive!\n\nOutside of that scenario, double check your username and password for spelling errors, as typos are the most common reason why people cannot access their e-mail accounts.

ny rangers, stars, philly, anaheim, carolina. i don't think any of those teams have a chance to get to the finals. 3 of those teams are behind two games in their series. dallas really is a disappointment to the west. the stars were a pick to win the cup but they won't due to their lack of hunger. philly just is too physical. carolina is too inexperienced. they say detroit is too old but i say they aren't. they have the most experience out of the playoff contenders and should have the most hunger for the cup. i think they will get past edmonton and colorado. they will face the flames and it will be a dog fight that will produce the winner of the cup. the eastern teams are good but not good enough outside of new jersey. i see a matchup of new jersey and detroit in the finals. seven games with detroit as the winner.
That will depend on how willing managment is to get some talent for him (i.e. healthy pitchers!). He will work his magic and make them better than last year simply because the team flat out quit on Baker and he should have a healthy Derrick Lee (and that should give him 10-12 wins over this years team alone). A healthy Lee and Ramirez in the middle of the order makes any manager better!
Jogging is one of the best things you can do to lose weight. If you are doing it along with healthy eating then you will do fine. Just make sure you eat enough, because you'll need plenty of energy to jog. Porridge for breakfast is perfect as it fills you up til lunch and provides good energy for running. Eat plenty of bananas too. Just don't skip meals as this will not help you lose weight at all. i would start off going out for 15 mins at a time, see how you feel and then the next week, increase it by 5-10 mins. You will get fitter and fitter. Just start off steady.

we are ethnocentric and geocentric...and both those words are probably getting looked up online right now. Most of us have never traveled outside the US. Most of us only speak one language and are equally offended and embarassed at our ignorance. Most of us vote for American Idol faster than for an election. We like top ten lists because anything that is more critical and complex is too hard to understand. We like fat gross food. We read simple newspapers like USA Today rather than anything more substantive. We complain about $3 gas when the UK pays $6.40...simply because we don't know what the hell is going on in the rest of the world. Many of us reading this answer probably aren't even sure if the UK means England, Scotland, Ireland, all of the above or none of the above. We vote for our president based on sound bites. We want easy, plain vanilla answers. Sex scares us in real life but we like it in movies and ads. We lack any historical perspective of both our own country and the rest of the world. When we encounter foreigners we speak LOUDER so that they understand us. We shy away from anything other than hamburgers, steak, and hotdogs. We wonder why the rest of the world cannot be more like us.

Cottonseed oil is commonly used in manufacturing potato chips and other snack foods. Along with soybean oil, it is very often partially or fully hydrogenated. The growing consensus is that in hydrogenated (trans fat) from these oils are very unhealthy. Cottonseed oil was the first oil to be hydrogenated in mass production, originally intended for candle production, and soon also as a food (as Crisco). In part because regulations apply differently to non-food crops, it has also been suggested that cottonseed oil may be highly contaminated with pesticide residues, but insufficient testing has been done

In the sport of cricket an over is a series of six consecutive balls bowled by a single bowler. No bowler is allowed to bowl in consecutive overs.\n\nSpecifically, an over must consist of six legal deliveries. No balls and wides do not count as one of the six balls in an over.\n\nIn one-day cricket bowlers are restricted to the total number of overs they may bowl in a match and the length of the game is determined by the total number of overs bowled (usually 40 or 50 per innings). In Test and county cricket, teams are usually required to bowl a minimum number of overs per day to prevent spoiling of the game by a slow over rate.\n\nEach consecutive over is bowled from the opposite end of the pitch ensuring that both batsmen face the bowling.\n\nA maiden over is one in which no runs are scored.\n\nTactical considerations in bowling overs\n\nThe over is a fundamental unit in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has six, and only six, legal balls before another bowler must bowl, he typically plans to use those six balls to set up a pattern of play designed to get a batsman out. For example, bowling a few balls with a repetitive line, length, or spin, followed by a variation designed to surprise the batsman.\n\nEarly in the over the bowler may tempt the batsman into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batsman takes the bait, the bowler can follow up with a variation designed either to hit the wicket or induce a catch. A batsman still in aggressive run-scoring mode may make a mistake playing the ball and end up losing his wicket.\n\nThe captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over (subject to the restriction that no bowler may bowl two overs in succession). Generally two bowlers will alternate overs from opposite ends of the pitch, until one tires or becomes ineffective, at which point the captain will replace that bowler with another. A period of bowling every second over like this is called a spell of bowling.\n\nTactical considerations in batting\n\nIf the two batsmen are not similar, tactical considerations may affect their play. If one batsman is stronger than the other, they may attempt to engineer their scores so that the stronger batsman faces the bowling more often. This may take the form of the stronger batsman trying to score an even number of runs on early balls in the over and an odd number on the last ball; the weaker batsman will attempt the reverse, and the bowler will try to disrupt this pattern.\n\nIf one batsman is right-handed and the other left-handed, they may try to score odd numbers of runs to disrupt the bowling pattern and tire the fielders by making them reposition themselves frequently.\n\nHistorical number of balls per over in Test cricket\n\nModern day Test cricket (since 1979/80) has been played all over the world with six balls per over. However, Test cricket started with 4 balls per over and has had varying number of balls per over around the world upto 1979/80.\n\nBalls per over\n\nIn England\n\n1880 to 1888: 4 \n1890 to 1899: 5 \n1902 to 1938: 6 \n1939 : 8 \n1946 to date: 6 \n\nIn Australia\n\n1876/77 to 1887/88: 4 \n1891/92 to 1920/21: 6 \n1924/25 : 8 \n1928/29 to 1932/33: 6 \n1936/37 to 1978/79: 8 \n1979/80 to date : 6 \n\nIn South Africa\n\n\n1891/92 to 1898/99: 5 \n1902/03 to 1935/36: 6 \n1938/39 to 1957/58: 8 \n1961/62 to date : 6 \n\nIn New Zealand\n\n1929/30 to 1967/68: 6 \n1968/69 to 1978/79: 8 \n1979/80 to date : 6 \n\nIn Pakistan\n\n1954/55 to 1972/73: 6 \n1974/75 to 1977/78: 8 \n1978/79 to date : 6 \n\nIn India, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and United Arab Emirates (venue, not host) all Test matches were played with 6 ball overs.

I find it hard to believe that. If he lost to Mayorga, he would probably set a rematch for September 16th. He was looking forward to fighting Pretty Boy Floyd then, but how could he resist going out with a vengeance? ;D\n\nI do believe he's going to retire soon, but unless Mayorga finds a way to completely dominate Oscar (which I doubt), I see De la Hoya sticking to that one last fight he has planned.
Just like any other business, hospitals need to market themselves. they all have websites, brochures, and advertising. Most likly the marketing center you are questioning is simply a marketing department, and thay are just trying to sound more sophisticated.\n\nIt is also possible that they have a big meeting room or media center wher they put on seminars or workshops. This tool is a marketing strategy. It brings people into the hospital. If they have a really excellent area for this, they may even let the community use it for non hospital business, again, it is just to bring more people into the hospital.\n\nBringing people in for any reason helps the comfort level and familiarity with the building, the parking and the ammenities. This will make many people more confidant and comfortable in choosing that hospital when they have a medical need.

You can not mix ECC with nonECC. However you can get another 512mb ECC RDRAM to go with the 512mb ECC RDRAM you already have.

Though muslims & christians have many principles in common, i guess they have many many diffrences, like what u said; muslims don't believe in Jesus Christ, they beleive no way God can become a human being, while chrisitians for example don't believe in Prophet Mohamed, and both beliefs are the core of religions, which means if u don't believe in Jesus Christ u can't be a chirsitan and if u don't believe in Prophet Mohamed u can't be a muslim, even the view of god in both religions are different, so i guess the answer would be no.

Simple! just as a resistor 'resists' current, an inductor 'inducts' current!!\n\nI mean an inductor induces current.

Also do check out these cool links on induction: \n\nhttp://www.cco.caltech.edu/~phys1/java/phys1/Inductance/Inductance.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance
Causes of yawning\nAn indication of tiredness, stress, over-work or boredom. \nAn action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert. \nA means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection or apathy. \nA sign that one is not breathing deeply, and not receiving enough oxygen through the body. \nA yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.\n\n \n\nA long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study documented that this effect does not exist ("Yawning" by Robert R. Provine, pages 532-539, American Scientist, November-December 2005, Vol 93, No. 6). [1]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often.\n\nAnother theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.\n\n \nA cockatiel yawningThe yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to "sympathetically" yawn.[2] The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct.[3] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth, thus proclaiming, "don't attack while I am sleeping..." The contagion of yawning is interspecific (i.e., try yawning in front of your dog). Ironically, yawning in public is generally regarded as impolite in the West, but came into fashion in polite French society for a brief period in the late 18th century. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word "yawn".\n\nAdelie Penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an "ecstatic display," their beaks open wide and their faces pointed skyward.

Maybe you can think of a way to relax him and make him forget his usual fears/anxieties about life/money/work?\n\nAnother reason could be that he is sexually conservative (because of upbringing or something). In this case, they will act embarrased if you suggest something too kinky/crazy. Break him in gently, if that is the case. Perhaps he wants to do something more romantic, but feels *silly* doing it - again a result of his growing-up environment.\n\nThink of all those things, and try to answer the question "why" is he passing out on the couch instead of spending time with the woman he married. That might get you the answers you need.

I'd recommend holding off on the stocks until you build some diversification with your investments. Try to build a nest egg of about $20K in mutual funds... trust me, you'll sleep better at night and not worry about a single stock plummeting on you. Once you have that foundation of mutual funds, invest in one stock at a time... perhaps a $2000 total investment per purchase. Buy three stocks... that's $6,000 total, etc. Whatever numbers you decide are best for you, start with a solid foundation of mutual funds.... because here's the fun part: as you buy individual stocks as I suggested, eventually you'll own 50 stocks or more... that's your own mini-mutual fund that you've created! Be sure your stocks are diversified... don't put all your money into stocks in the same industry. Spread your money around... you'll be glad you did. Good luck.

There is much I do not like about this country and its capitulation to everyone and everything is starting to annoy many people. I can see it all ending in tears in years to come.\nGreat Britain is Christian, yet all christians now have to celebrate almost in private, I dont get that, but then I dont get what the Labour Party is trying to acheive either. If it is to alienate the British public and divide communities then they are doing a grand job. If it was to unite a mult-cultural Britain then they have failed in style.\nOn the same hand, the methods of the BNP are not right either.\nI would only hope that someone somewhere in power gets a grip and actually talks to the people rather than sitting in their Ivory towers thinking they know what is right. There was a thing called common sense, I believe it is now called the opposite.

His affection is nice, but I can see it's unwanted. It must be hard for him to move on after a long relationship like that. It's not bad to keep talking to him, but if he's being pushy about getting back together you need to say something about it. Especially since you have a new guy and he's with someone else. He needs to focus on that new relationship before she finds out that hes still focused on you.

Cold and snow here lasts through late April/early May when we experience Spring "break up"...when the snow melts and everything turns into a muddy mess. Other parts of the state see their snowfall start earlier or later, depending on physical location in the state, proximity to the coastlines, etc.

Try to reconnect with him by thinking of the reasons why you got together with him in the first place. If you still don't want to be with him, you should know the best way to tell him because you have been with him for 18 years. It's going to hurt him, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth staying or leaving.
good observation, but due to the number of players in the NBA, it would get out. The seven game series is for money... look at the salaries of these guys. They're athletes, not actors... and in some people its obvious... FLOPPERS!, haha but no its not rigged. Also who ever said egos, thats a good point as well. Would Shaq be able to lose on purpose?? He can't stand going with out the ball for two seconds (cry baby) haha. Also why would men like Grant Hill, Alonzo Mourning, and even Dajuan Wagner fight so hard to come back to a rigged sport? If they know no matter how hard they try, they could never be the team picked to win the championship.

First, it depends on who you are and your relationship to the inmate. For the most part, that type of information is not public, and security and safety reasons, the institution will not release it. \n\nHowever, for example, if you are a wife, and your husband is about to be released, he will know the exact day. Then you can arrange with the institution for the time that you can meet him.\n\nIf you are a victim of the inmate, again, release is not public information.

they most likely mean nothing. This appears to be one of many heretical documents created during the reign of THeospacy in England. Since many of the documents were formed by the process of 'ghost writing' (relying on spritual impulses or dreams to form content) random infomration can appear more significant than intended.\n\n-Intresting note: SOme of the names have been changed from the orginal document, according to the footnotes, based on further 'translation' of the heavenly language. It would appear that the names are suppose to have meaning in the language of 'heaven' which some teoshpists and today's new-agers belive would give them mystic power if they could learn to speak it.

Well, I don't have oily skin but i have acne all over. There are some products out there that are just for oily skin and not that expensive. I bought this Neutrogena stuff [and it was just like Proactiv except cheap!] and it's already working in just about a week. If you are still having oily skin, carry around some of those clearasil pads and wipe your face during breaks and stuff.
Many Christians look for forms of evil to confirm their own beliefs. Wicca is gaining popularity and Christianity is in decline. They blame Wicca for what they see as a decline in morals of the youth of the nation. Because they define any stray from christianity as a betrayal of God and all that is good. \n\nThey don't understand, nor do they care to understand, the concepts or purpose of our beliefs. They just look at it as a threat to the world they have created.\n\nA world where sex is evil.\nA world where magik is an abomination.\nA world where they can make laws that follow the rules of their religion and not the will of the people. \n\nThey are blind to everything else and so filled with ignorant hate that they lash out at us and try so hard to suppress it. \n\nSee you in 2042.
Tough Guy ~\n In my opinion, Joey gets Knocked out cold in less than 5 rounds. Joey was a real tough cookie back in the day, but he lacked the power to hurt and stop Herans. Herans being the much taller of the two would throw his right hand at will and catch Giardello every time he threw it. Joey was notorious for getting hit a lot.\n A little inside bit for you, Augie Semeca who use to be Charles Brewer's trainer and one time South Philadelphia Gym owner and I were talking a couple months back at Joe Hands Gym in South Philly about tough fighters from Philly and I brought up Giardello and about two minutes later Joey came walking through the door. He sat down and started talking to Augie and Augie introduced me to him, anyways to make a long story short and without pulling any punches Joey said "I never trained, I'd be out with the boys all of the time, I didn't have time to train, there was too much going on. I was always a tough kid and could handle my own, but I never fully dedicated myself to the sport."\n Tommy's workouts with Steward at the Kronk Gym are legendary. I worked out at the gym before and it's always HOT in there no matter what time of the year you're there. Tommy worked the pads with Manny and it would resemble a actual fight. Tommy would hit the bag for a hour straight with only a minute rest between rounds. Milton McCory would often be heard saying "That man aint right, alls he wants to do is train like a crazy man"\n This would be the biggest difference in this fight Tommy would be able to go non-stop until he stops Giardello, don't get me wrong here, Joey wouldn't be a push over he'd crack Tommy with some good shots too, but it wouldn't be enough to keep Tommy off of him.

pool and billiards and snooker are all types of billiard games. billiards is more a "gentleman's" name, while pool is more slang/street. some call 14.1 or straight pool billiards.\n\nTable differences:\nmost billiard games are played on a 7' (bar table) 8' (recreational table) or 9' table (pro table or tournament length). an american snooker table is 10' in length while an english snooker table is 12' (long long loooonnnngg table to shoot across). there is also a carom table to play 3 cushion on which is 10' long\n\nBalls differences:\nin most pool games; 8, 9 ball, one pocket and many others use of 15 numbered balls and a cue ball that are the standard 2 1/4" dia ball. in carom or 3 cushion they use 3 balls (2 whites and 1 red) that are 2 7/16" dia. snooker they play with 15 red balls, 6 numbered balls and a cue ball that are 2 1/6" dia.\n\nRules differences:\ni will refer you to the billiard congress of america site. the rules differences would take way to long to post here.\n\nhttp://www.bca-pool.com/start.shtml\n\nEquipment differences:\nbasically the equipment is the same. rules change from game to game but basically billiards is played with a cue, 58" in length weighing 17oz - 21oz typically. bridges and jump cues are legal to use in some billiards games, but check and read to know when and where.

if you are going to hike through the island, bring a frame pack. if your going for seven days, bring ten days worth of clothes, but always extra socks and underwear. regular clothes, rain gear, cooking stuff, like pots and pans and water purification tablets or filters. plenty of matches, get a map of the area and a compass, make sure you know how to use both. bring walkie talkies, an emergency beacon if you can afford it, emergency kits are a good idea, they usually come with mirrors to signal someone, water proof matches, space blankets, and other survival equipment.\nbring at least three really sharp knives as well as a small sharping stone, and axes or hatchets, lots of rope and maybe even a tarp or something. \nthey have freeze dried meals which cut a lot of weight and space. they are usually five bucks a meal, but there is a lot of food in them and its pretty good. just add hot water, let soak for 15 minutes and enjoy. \nmake sure to bring a decent tent.\nmost importantly, know where you are going, let people know where you are going and how long your gonna be there.\nif possible, get a gps. bring extra batteries for it. lanterns are always a plus, as well as a few flashlights.\nbefore you go anywhere, ask yourself, whats the weather going to be like, whats the nearest civilized spot, wild animals, stuff like that.\nbe prepared for the worse but hope for the best.\ngood luck
hey bud-\n\nthis is impossible but...\n\n"Achilles Last Stand" is the best song of Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe song is one of the longest Zeppelin songs, at 10 minutes and 25 seconds. The song is famous for John Bonham's immensely powerful drumming, John Paul Jones's galloping bass line (played on a custom made eight string bass), Jimmy Page's overdubbed orchestral guitar arrangement (incredibly the dozen or so guitar tracks on this song were recorded in one session), and a dramatic, epic guitar solo which is considered by many to be among Page's best.\n\nPage has been quoted saying that it is his favorite Led Zeppelin song, so that should go a long way\n\ni guess my personal favorite is No Quarter or How Many More Times

You shouldn't expect a shallow girl to develop a crush on you but "any" girl? How about the beauty that shines within you? Surely some girl is going to notice that for that shine within you will shine without as well.\n\nThe greatest love of my life was 4 feet six inches tall - and I am five feet ten inches tall - and we lasted for 27 years until he passed away.\nWhat he lacked in height, he was taller in so many more important ways. Sometimes he rose above everyone else in my opinion.\n\nSo let people see the wonderful talents you possess because external beauty fades but inner beauty lasts and is a joy forever to behold.

Why Do Hindus Worship Many Gods?\n\nHuman beings through history have formulated many different names and forms for the Divine or Eternal. Just as we have many names and forms for other things, whether it is foods, or types of art, so too, in religion a similar great diversity has been created.\n\nThe Western world has prided itself in monotheism, the idea that there is only One God as the highest truth. Western religions have said that only the names and forms which refer to this One God are valid but those which appear to worship another God, or a multiplicity of divinities, must be false. They have restricted the names and forms they use in religious worship, and insist that only one set is true and correct and others are wrong or unholy. \n\nAs a universal formulation Hinduism accepts all formulations of Truth. According to the universal view there is only One Reality, but it cannot be limited to a particular name or form. Though Truth is One it is also Universal, not an exclusive formulation. It is an inclusive, not an exclusive Oneness - a spiritual reality of Being - Consciousness - Bliss, which could be called God but which transcends all names. The different Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism represent various functions of this One Supreme Divinity, and are not separate Gods. \n(Having many names for something is not necessarily a sign of ignorance of its real nature. On the contrary, it may indicate an intimate knowledge of it. For example, Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow in their language because they know snow intimately in its different variations, not because they are ignorant of the fact that all snow is only one. The many different deities of Hinduism reflect such an intimate realization of the Divine on various levels.)
Politics is just a way to govern. Think as if you had five million dollars and fifteen million people. 5% are low income people and need assistance, 25% are small business owners and need some help starting their own business, 65% are a good median class workers and they are paying taxes that are giving you those five million dollars and only 5% are people who are helping you out running things out, yet each of those 5% have to report and give the best to the people who they are representing, poor, small business owners, median class workers etc.. If you do not know how to negotiate all the money could go into one grup and not the others that will not be good for you as the keeper of the money and one of the ones who has to decide how to spend it. There is where politics have to be used, negociate, deal, trade, share, meet, built, and somethimes get upset, but always keeping in mind that it is for the greather good of all the individuals eventhough some get the longest part of the stick, but that is how the game is played, those who know the rules they learn to apply them towards their advantage and those who desire to ignore or not learn them are stuck under the ones who know how to play the game. Just know how Monopoly is a great game to start in politics 101.

Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state. At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc). You can do this yourself, or use an attorney. In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC. If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as). This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in. Call you county clerks office to check on this.\n\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\n\nABC Shipping\nABC Shopping\nABC Whatever\n\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.

This is the point in the life of a plant that is most fragile. You can either make or break it at this point. A seed is extremely resilient to dehydration and all manner of environmental situations. However, once you plant and water that seed, it will emerge and is extremely vulnerable. The root system has not developed so it needs steady water. The seedling is not large enough to store a lot of water or nutrients. As such, it needs conditions that will be stable until it can establich itself. It has not developed the layers of tissue to regulated it's temperature that well and if it does not get enough water, it will die and there is no turning back. It will not regrow, unlike a well established plant that can wilt when dry and then come back to life.

Mother's Day gifts are supposed to come from the heart...something you put thought into rather than something she may have wanted. That's just my opinion though as both a mother and a daughter.

• The Law of Segregation: The two members of a gene pair (alleles) segregate (separate) from each other in the formation of gametes. Half the gametes carry one allele, and the other half carry the other allele.\n\n• The Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits assort independently of one another in the formation of gametes.\n\nAfter research of first two laws scientists came up with: Some alleles are incompletely dominant, that some genes are sex-linked, and that some pairs of genes do not assort independently because they are physically linked on a chromosome.

YES it is really love! I believe he really does love you, but is deeply afraid of commitment. Has he ever lost anyone who was very close to him, like someone in his family? If so, this may be his source of a deep-seated fear. He is most likely afraid of messing up a full-fledged relationship with you and is why he "stays close to you" but will not commit all the way. \n\n If he only remains "friends w/ benefits" and you reject him he can convince himself "No Big Deal" we were just friends anyway. But if you two are an exclusive item and you reject him for what ever reason, I think that the rejection would be far to devastating for him to bare. So he plays it safe. Many men have the same fear of rejection we just don't show it.

As a child or person that has not passed through puberty the genitals are the same color as the rest of the skin on our body. When you mature one of the first signs of adult hood is the darkening of the skin in the genital area. So the penis skin is darker and the scrotum skin is darker than the rest of the body. Why I don't know. It just occurs. I don't know why you worry about such things.

Usually the contract signed would cover this, and most of the time the answer would be YES, you are expected to pay the moving allowance back. However, that is usually prorated, so you'd only have to pay back the 1 month worth. Check the contract you signed for specifics.\n\nThat said, if a company fires you they probably won't bother collecting the moving allowance. If there's something wrong with an employee, many companies prefer to cut their losses and get rid of the employee as cleanly as possible. Tying up additional resources to recoup a small amount of money (comparatively) is usually not worth their while. But you can't count on this. Assume the company will do whatever the contract says they will do.

The periodic table is divided into sections by chemists in order to make it easier to talk about elements that behave in similar fashions. The periodic table makes this possible by organizing elements by the number of electrons in each orbital. The transition metals, the family that platinum and Iridium both belong in, is made up of elements that in their elemental (as opposed to compound) form have a d orbitals as their last filled orbital. This gives them some similar properties and ways in which they will react. Which is why scientists call them families.
Unless any of us are a legitimate fortune teller we can only speculate. But being a woman, myself, and from a woman's point of view, if your wife has told you she is going to come home, then try and relax. Have faith in what she is saying. Maybe this is a flaw in your marriage that needs to get worked out. You are going to run your self mentally crazy, if you can't believe your mate. Quit wasting precious energy being suspicious. Channel this energy into thinking what you are going to do differently when she comes home to work out the original problem. Tell yourself, you have nothing to fear, but your own suspicions. I promise you, that most break ups are caused by one or the other, accusing them of doing something. They figure if they are going to be accused, they might as well do it. Not good logic, but we are talking about love, and there is no logic in this emotion. Keep faith!!!
I agree with your point, but that's the problem. Those that argue AGAINST homeschooling, do not do the research to back up their standpoint, and that is ignorant. Someone on here said that they sit in a classroom and aren't distracted?! Was my school the only one in the world who's students passed notes back and forth when the teacher's backs were turned, were obsessed with who was dating who, who dumped who, what was going on that weekend... instead of paying attention in class? For the record, when you're working with your child one on one, you don't NEED six hours of school a day. 2-3 is adequate enough. How can you get distracted with only 2-3 hours of school a day? Even if you're having a sick day you can manage to work 2-3 hours, no problem. Do the research before you talk. I never participated in school sports, thought they were retarded. I didn't like team activities, because unless you're really good at it, you get harassed by the ones who do... they're the ones with the attitudes. And, imagine that... I never participated in sports, never went to dances,etc. where all the drama was, yet I was able to be successful in every job I had and be a team player. Hmmm, maybe maturity has more to do with being a team player than being on a sports team. Stupid analogy for a teacher, you think you'd come up with something better than that. If my children decide they want to compete, there are plenty of city sports, karate classes, dance classes, all that compete and often go to other areas to do it, competing nationally. Also, some schools work with homeschoolers instead of against them and allow the students to go to school just for p.e. and sports. There are more opportunities when you're homeschooled than in a public school. Yes, I went to a 'normal' school growing up, and that's what made me decide on homeschooling. If 'normal' means backstabbing each other, lying, stealing, cheating, being self-centered, slacking off responsibility, and being constantly in a popularity contest, I don't want anything to do with it, and I certainly don't want my kids being 'normal' in that respect. Because that is not a representation of real life when they graduate. You act like that on a job and you won't have a job anymore. School is nothing like the work force. We all get to pick what jobs we do, where we work, IF we work. You don't get those options in school, you're stuck. At home, as long as the kids get the work done it really doesn't matter what hours they're doing it. If they have a bad day (my child is autistic, bad days happen and it's pointless to work on them), nobody is going to give him a bad mark because they're mad that they didn't get paid for him to be there, he simply picks it up the next day. There's much more choices for homeschooled kids then public, or even private. Do the research or don't bother to answer the questions.
I don't try to get Christians upset. I come hear to talk about and get peoples opinion on religion. That is why I am here. Am I so profane or is that a "general" statement? My heart has softened to those I think are duped into myth. I mean no disrespect. But we do have opposing opinions. \nThis is a R and S board. So the "topic" of R&S is discussed not necessarily promoted or agreed upon.\nAs I must work with so many believers and associate and even risk my life alongside them, I seek to understand them more. That is why I am here. Why are you here?\nBTW I like your question.

It is actually possible, but you really, really would not want it:\nThey can take a brain out of the casing, but think of it, they'd have to cut all nerval connections to the body: eyes, spine etc. \nThe brain might conceivable be kept alive, properly fixed to a machine that pumps oxygenated and nutrient-enriched blood to the brain, but what would you do then? This actually has been done to a few pitiful lab animals.\nYou would definitely need to hook the brain up to a body again, it would need hormonal regulation (we cannot completely reproduce the body in a lab) but how would you do that in any meaningful way? You would end up with a brain hooked up to the circulation system of a prone body without any sensory or muscular connection - we cannot yet get nerves to reconnect as we want them, else spinal cord injuries could be fixed. So you'd only end up with a terminally isolated brain without any sensory input and without any ability to communicate - sheer hell. For all practical purposes, you'd have a body and a brain worse than dead.
If you're going to feel guilty, put that feeling into action. This is anecdotal evidence, but I have seen what a terrible effect Wal-Mart has had on the small Texas town where I grew up in the 70s. Most of the family-owned retail shops have closed; downtown is in ruins - there's no good excuse for kids to hang out there the way they used to. Money that used to be reinvested in the community gets paid to a corporate conglomerate with draconian labor practices and wages that are so low that the U.S. taxpayer has subsidizes Wal-Mart employees who don't get benefits packages.\n\nThe place is sterile, the employees cultish. There's no specialized knowledge built up in individual departments. When there was a record shop on Hiram Street, the man who ran it and the kids who worked for him knew about music. The tire store salesman knew about tires. No one at Wal-Mart has that kind of institutional expertise. They're all about being low-priced and friendly, but they're completely removed from the products that they sell. And it's all sanitized, scripted, and carefully censored so that nobody gets his/her sensibilities challenged. \n\nWorst of all, I think Wal-Mart has played a pivotal role in making people believe that they need things they don't need, and want things they don't have any use for. The whole store is a tease, a come-on without a pay-off. (In this respect, Wal-Mart is no different from other players in modern consumer culture; except that Wal-Mart has found a way to destabilize and manipulate people who really don't have very much into wanting more and having even less. It's like a casino in that respect.)\n\nWhere are all the Wal-Schools and Wal-Computers and Wal-Vaccination programs? The Wal-Institute for Public Health? It may be my ignorance in play here, but the Walton family has been fabulously wealthy for a very long time, but they don't seem to have developed a public conscience. They hide behind the good-old-boy image of their late founder. But it's time they started giving back. They've helped destroy a landscape in my hometown that's irreplaceable.
Do you want to ftp files automatically using scripts or do you want to design a ftp client. Ftping files in .net to me seems a bit tricky although just yesterday I discovered you can use webclient object which has an uploadfile method to do file transfers. The other question would be do you want to implement a pull or push ftp. \n\nEdit: Take a look at these links :\n\nhttp://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive9.html\n\nhttp://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/36s52zhs.aspx\n\nThe first gives you a ftp client library code which you can then use within your application. The second link talks about the webclient object and how to use it. There is a downloadfile method available with webclient as well. Give them a try\n\nhope this helps

That's why communication is important in a relationship. After 3yrs you should be able to freely express your feelings with each other. Best thing to do is just tell her, don't worry about if it will hurt her, best thing to do is be honest. It would hurt her more to stay because actions speak louder than words and soon your feelings will start to surface, so instead of putting her through all kinds of emotional abuse just tell her and then leave. She'll later respect you for handling it like a man.

protein needs training to function well on the muscle, and creation works as a power enhancer that gives u higher performance in gym ...\n\nI tried both, and i gained 10 kilos after using them in 3 month. You have to watch out for the recommandations and know what to use according to your condition.\n\nBut yet for weight gain i suggest whey proteins, and creatin wait untill u need to push more in gym start taking it, and for more effective result there is some kind of proteins that work in making the muscle keep its new size and not lose it if u had to stop gym for a while (maybe such stuff might be added with the creatin you are using)\n\nOne last note: dont use liquid creatin its not effective at all, and its having defects.

I think about 1/3 of the people come one here for a legitimate reason....to gain knowledge about something they know thing about, need help in, etc. I found this site by accident, trying to help my daughter find an answer regarding algebra (not my subject, just ask the teachers I had in high school). Read all the info about how to get points so you can ask more questions if you so desire so I figured I would answer questions, etc. just in case she needed more help with something I can't answer.\n\nI saw some really stupid questions, and I had to laugh when I saw a lot of people giving dumb answers or just the typical "thanks for the 2 points" answers. I don't even bother with them. Yeah, I could get 2 easy points but like I said I don't bother with it. It's kind of pointless.\n\nThis thing can be addicting as far as answer questions (good or stupid) and really wanting to help someone.

I really hate that crap. And it infuriates me. I once read that something that is common to every human being is that we want to be valued. When someone totally ignores what I've said, and thinks it's so cool when they find out about it somewhere else later, or, when the bozos "discover" it themselves and have no recollection that I was the one that told them about it, it is such a de-valuing experience. It makes me angry, it makes me want to do ANYTHING to get them to give me some credit. And the sad thing is, it happens all through life, not just when you're young. The only thing I can do is try to never dismiss people in my life, and to value what they say.

Le Comptoir\n37 rue Berger, 1st (01.40.26.26.66). M° Les Halles. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Thur, Sun; noon-3am Fri, Sat. \nCredit MC, V. \n\nAmid the busy commerce of Les Halles, Le Comptoir is an oasis of calm overlooking the gardens behind St-Eustache church. The decor is Moroccan to the last detail: deep-red rugs, coloured-glass chandeliers, low-slung leather stools and banquettes piled high with cushions. A young, worldly crowd lounges around drinking thé à la menthe - served as it should be with pine nuts bobbing on top. Friendly service and a lethal selection of cocktails make a perfect spot for leisurely drinking. Attractive Franco-Moroccan menu, too.\n\nLe Fumoir\n6 rue de l’Amiral-de-Coligny, 1st (01.42.92.00.24). M° Louvre Rivoli. \nOpen 11am-2am daily. Closed 2wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nThis elegant bar directly opposite the Louvre has now become a bit of a Parisian institution: inside neo-colonial fans whirr lazily, oil paintings adorn the walls and even the bar staff seem to have been included in the interior decorator’s sketches. A sleek crowd sipping Martinis or browsing the papers at the long mahogany bar (originally from a Chicago speakeasy) gives way to young professionals in the restaurant and pretty young things in the library. It can feel a little try-hard and well-behaved, but some expertly mixed cocktails and a little friendly flirting with the PRs on the prowl are guaranteed to take the edge off the evening. \n\nHemingway Bar at the Ritz\nThe Ritz, 15 pl Vend? 1st (01.33.43.16.30.30). M? Madeleine or Concorde. \nOpen 6.30pm-2am Tue-Sat. Closed 3wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, DC, MC, V. \n\nThis much lauded bar has become a cocktailers’ cliché, but that’s because it’s simply one of the loveliest places in Paris to do drinkies. The dark wood, muffled laughter, black-and-white photos of Papa H and the old-school charm of Colin the head barman and lovely Ludo his second, make the bar a cocoon from the horrors of the outside world. Leather seating and five-star service (a glass of berry-scented water appears within 30 seconds of arrival) preface cocktails are as near to alcoholic nirvana as possible - not least the divine raspberry Martini. Pulling in its fair share of characters, honeymooners and expense-account nerds, it’s also a wonderful place to see what the human race does in its spare time. Opened across the corridor is the Cambon Bar: the original Ritz bar, done up as it was back in its ’20s heyday.\n\nKong\n1 rue du Pont-Neuf, 1st (01.40.39.09.00). M° Pont Neuf. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Sat. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nPhilippe Starck’s latest addition to the Paris scene is, predictably, one of the city’s hottest places to do cocktails, ideally located on the top two floors of the Kenzo building overlooking the Pont Neuf. The bright mishmash interior is manga-inspired with lots of neon, Hello Kitty knick-knacks, comfy grey leather sofas and rocking chairs at the main dining tables, best avoided after a few too many coupes. The best bet is to perch at the long bar, flirt with the too-beautiful-to-bartend staff and order an excellent vodkatini or three. After dark you can make a music suggestion with each order - at weekends they somehow carve out a tiny dancing space for the trendy crowd to strut their stuff on. Wear lots of labels and try your best to look cool while half-cut. \n\n\nLe Couvent\n69 rue Broca, 13th (01.43.31.28.28). M° Les Gobelins. \nOpen 9am-2am Mon-Fri; 6pm-2am Sat. \nCredit MC, V. \n\nFor an address located in the middle of nowhere, this heavily beamed bar creates a delightful hideaway. It first appeared in Pierre Gripari’s two-part short-story collection Contes de la rue Broca, but it has come a long way since those dingy days. Nowadays it’s the chouchou of students and thirtysomething couples, especially at concert time when live chords get feet tapping. Always busy, always smoky. \n\nRhubarb\n18 rue Laplace, 5th (01.43.25.35.03). M° Maubert Mutualité. \nOpen
It doesn't sound like he really wants to be in a committed relationship with you. If he was serious he wouldn't have cheated. He cheated on you not once but twice, according to him. It's probably more than that like when a cop pulls over a drunk driver and they say "oh, i only had two beers". I'd say goodbye and move on. As far as going back to being platonic friends it would probably be too awkward and painful and it won't be the same as before.
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ME I HAVE NO PROBLEM TELLING ANYONE WHAT I HAVE SAID NONE.... I MAY CHANGE WORDS TO DEFUSE THE IMPACT WHEN TELLING THEM.... BUT I ALWAYS TELL THEM IF THERE IS A PROBLEM I MAKE SURE THOUGH I PULL THEM ASIDE AND DO IT.... NOW JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU CAN NOT ALWAYS LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY THEY PUT THEIR OWN SPIN ON THE STATEMENT TRYING TO CAUSE FRICTION.... THE BEST THING TO DO IS TALK TO THE PERSON ALONE TO GET THEM TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID WITH NO ONE AROUND IT WILL DIFFUSE ANGER OR PREVENT PEOPLE INSTIGATING UP THE SITUATION

not sure but maybe your talking about sleep paralysis: you kinda feel like you're awake but you can't move or that you might fall or you try to speak but you can't sorta like you're frozen awake---maybe that wiki thing has something -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by paralysis of the body shortly after waking up (known as hypnopompic paralysis) or, less often, shortly before falling asleep (known as hypnagogic paralysis). Physiologically, it is closely related to the normal paralysis that occurs during REM sleep, also known as REM atonia.\n\n \nThe Nightmare, by Henry Fuseli (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a demonic visitation.Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is awakened from an REM state into essentially a normal fully awake state, but the bodily paralysis is still occurring. This causes the person to be fully aware, but unable to move. In addition, this state is usually accompanied by certain specific kinds of hallucinations. This state usually lasts no more than two minutes before a person is able to either return to full REM sleep or to become fully awake,(more in the article but I didn't want the post to be too long.) Thanks :-)

No if you prepare every sentence it will look funny. If you plan to do so then please do rehearse so nicely that your dictiona nd your delivery looks absolutely spontaneous.\n\nIf you are a good speaker, just made a structure in points and write down notings about phrases or quotations to be used. It will look very natural and you will also have flexibility to incorporate last minute changes or replies to other peoples point in your delivery. \n\nThats oKay if u made the full speech - in fact it'll make ur life easier. Transfer the key point to a notesheet and try and associate the meat of the sentence into the point!

The problem with Ebay is that you pay a fee. Craigslist is the best because you don't have to worry about long distance shipping (a lot of drums I see on Ebay are shipped internationally and the postage is more than the drum is bidding for) and you don't owe a fee or a commission if you sell. And it has a subsite for most large US cities and even has a category for musical instruments.

Try sound. The musical scale is a log base 2 scale (A = 440, and 880, and 220), while sound loudness is logarithmic, that's why they use decibels. Double the power output from an amp and you have a (log of 2 = 0.3, times ten =3dB gain). Look at the volume control on an amp or radio, its logarithmic, not linear. Also, try the Beaufort wind scale, this is based on effect, not on a linear scale; earthquakes (again, based on effect); Clouds (no scale at all). \nTo make it easy why not start with earthquakes. This is an effect based scale so the students will be able to assess easily the effect on the local population.

I have already answered a question similar to this one but here's my opinion once again.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe that PRIDE has the best MMA competitors in the world. The main reason for that is quite simple. They are by far the highest paying MMA organization today and all the top fighters want to work there. \n\nAnd as far as weight divisions individually are concerned situation looks more less like this:\n\nUFC heavyweights are nowhere near PRIDE level. With fighters like Fedor Emelianenko, Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, Mirko CRO COP Filipovic, Sergei Kharitonov, Josh Barnett, Aleksander Emelianenko, Fabricio Werdum, Mark Hunt and so on PRIDE is completely dominant in this division. UFC's best Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski wouldn't even make top 8 in PRIDE.\n\nPRIDE is also dominant in LHW division with Wanderlei Silva, Mauricio SHOGUN Rua, Ricardo Arona, Hidehiko Yoshida, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, Alister Overeem all there (their only big minus was the recent loss of Quinton RAMPAGE Jackson who signed for WFA). UFC, now that Randy Couture is retired, really only has two top level fighters in that weight class - Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell. Sobral, Bonar and Griffin are good fighters but they're not on the level of PRIDE's best.\n\nMiddleweight division is at the moment about even in PRIDE and UFC but there are really only two kings in this weight class and the rest of the competition is not on their level. They are of course Rich Franklin and Dan Henderson and that would be a dream match.\n\nWelter weight division (-170 lbs) PRIDE doesn't have (well they call -185 lbs division welter) but Matt Hughes is the undisputed champion and the best fighter in the world in that class and UFC's fighters are best there, no question about that.\n\nLightweights are without doubt better in PRIDE with Takanori Gomi, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Hayato Sakurai, Joachim Hansen, Luiz Azeredo and so on all there.\n\nSo I agree with you, PRIDE is better then UFC.

Like many parts of the American political system, the idea of a cabinet was borrowed from Great Britain. Hundreds of years ago, the word cabinet referred to a small room, no bigger than a cabinet, that was located near the private rooms of the king or queen. The monarch's advisors would be brought to the cabinet for confidential discussions about the empire. The most trusted advisors visited the cabinet most often. They came to be called the cabinet counsel, or simply, the cabinet

that's impossible. there's always the chance that you'll be rejected, but being rejected is better than not knowing at all. b/c then you'll be wondering for heaven knows how long, if you and that person were supposed to be together. rejection hurts, yes, i know it does. but it goes away in time. like a cut it heals, but the emotional healing is possibly slower than the physical healing. if you don't ask someone out---if you don't risk that, then what is the point in living? it's all about chance. the worst they can say is no. and if that's the case, there's plenty more people out there...also, they didn't deserve you. your significant other is out there waiting for you, you just have to look---and believe. if you believe enough, anything can happen.

OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ), although the mechanism that causes the cycling is unknown. Current research seems focused around sodium channels. The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.

You're right in many ways, except one. Be honest, if a woman knew she could do things better than a man, would she retain the same respect for him? It's not that men fear being weaker. it's they have to appear stronger or society treats them differently. Example: My wife and I both worked, she worked graveyard as a nurse, so she could be home during the day when the kids came home. She got put on days and we were having trouble with our oldest daughter. We had saved money and I was in the position to take time off from work.\n I did the shopping, running errands etc. Even our friends began to question my motives. Joking I was living off of a woman, not pulling my weight and the jokes flew one after another. Even though we had to cut back a little we were far from starving, yet people made stupid jokes. We had decided together it was the right thing for us, but that didn't matter. Women have the choice of being a stay at home mother, men don't have the same choices. We are accused of being lazy, weak, stupid. So be careful when you say men are afraid of appearing weak, because maybe in your eyes they already are. And well all is said and done, will a 'weak' man be enough for you, or someone equal intellectually be better? Why oh why do women send out mixed signals?
Hm - good question.\n\nI think the myth of an optimum political-economic system would probably be a stronger contender (at least in the developed world).\nThe myth of progress (ie. that "progress" is always a good thing) is another likely one.\n\nOn a mythos (rather than philosophical) level, the Star Wars films are probably the great global myth of our time (kids in all kinds of countries/languages know all the details - far more intensely than they know about any version of God).\n\nGod was probably the most important myth of previous times, but hasn't been for a while. Another good question might be "When did God cease being the most important myth?"\nSome time between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution?

The speed of a computer depends on various factors. RAM and the Processor are examples of hardwares which determine the computer speed. Other factors are software related factors such as Presence of Anti virus and Anti spyware etc decreases speed, Full harddisc decreases the speed, Presence of large hard disc partitions also decreases speed.\nFor increasing your computer's speed you can add some more RAM to your system. You can make smaller hard disc partitions. In addition to this regular use of disc defragmenter and disc cleanup also increases speed to some extent.

Lloyd Quarterman was one of six Blacks on the Manhatten Project which produced the first Atomic bomb. In ?, he was cited by the U.S. Secretary of War for "work essential to the production of the Atomic Bomb, thereby contributing to the successful conclusion of World War II."\n\nQuaterman worked at Columbia University, and at the Argonne National Laboratory, which he joined in 1946. At Argonne, major research and development of nuclear reactors took place. The team of scientists that Dr. Quarterman worked with developed the first nuclear reactor for the Nautilus, an atomic powered submarine. In 1947, he studied Quantum Mechanics under Enrico Fermi.
If you have tried to contact him twice, but received no reply, I think it's fairly obvious that he is not interested in pursuing anything with you - friendship or otherwise.

There are several "browsing" sites out there that will basically let you visit random sites. I would personally not want to visit any and all sites on the web (there's a lot of junk I don't want to waste my time with), but hey, if that's what you want you can do it. One cool site I've seen that offers semi-random surfing is http://www.stumbleupon.com/ Stumble upon shows you sites that other people have recommended, so at least (hopefully) you won't get lost in a sea of junky sites. You can view totally random sites if you want, or browse by category, which is very cool.

If all were in their primes, I would say Flair. Remember, Terry Funk in his prime was not the Terry Funk we see now. He was NWA champ for 2 years and fought some tough matches, but nowhere near the the "hardcore" matches we see him in now. Also his skills with the mic were not as strong as they are now, so a booker would most likely not give him a title vs. Flair to be the standard bearer for a promotion. As for Race/Flair, these guys went against each other tons of times, with Flair getting the upper hand in the series.
It is supposed to make perfect sense. Number of ways to arrange 0 things is 1, since there are only one way, doing nothing.\nNot only that, this works nicely when you work with combination. There is also a generalization of factorial in real numbers, and you can also get 0!=1 from the new definition of factorial in real numbers.

These two tests are totally and completely different. SAT tests are interested in strictly knowledge. Basically, how well you can do math and grammar exercises (analogies, etc). IQ tests are interested in how logical of a person you are, and how deeply you read into things. There are also lots of "problem solving" kind of questions on there.\n\nIn any case, these two types of tests are completely different.\n\nHope this helps.

For anyone that ascribes to Darwin's origin of the species theory (where there is no God who could call all things seen and unseen into exsitence with the command of his Word), war should not be a problem, because there is no finite moral standard... it is survival of the fittest. Eat... or be eaten, Kill or be killed.\nFor those who have a life-trusting faith in God, it is sometimes harder to decide, since we are past those times when God tells his people to go and eliminate this group or that "so that you may have the land that I have promised you."\nIn current times we need to be loyal to our friends who call for aid. We may sometimes need to step out and rescue a people from an unbelievably oppressive governmental hardship, particularly when that government gives all the signs that it not only materially supports terrorism but that it will conduct unprovoked war on other peaceful nations.
What is White gold?\n\nWhite gold is an alloy of gold and some white metals such as silver and palladium. White gold can be 18ct, 14ct, 10ct or any karat. For example, 18ct yellow gold is made by mixing 75% gold (750 parts per thousand) with 25% (250 parts per thousand) other metals such as copper and zinc. 18ct white gold is made by mixing 75% gold with 25% other metals such as silver and palladium. So the amount of gold is the same but the alloy is different.\n\nTraditionally nickel was used in white gold, however, nickel is no longer used in most white gold made today as nickel can cause reactions with some people. We generally do not use or sell nickel in our white gold.\n\nWhen white gold rings are new they are coated with another white metal called Rhodium. Rhodium is a metal very similar to platinum and Rhodium shares many of the properties of platinum including its white color.\n\nThe rhodium plating is used to make the white gold look more white. The natural color of white gold is actually a light grey color. The Rhodium is very white and very hard, but it does wear away eventually. To keep a white gold ring looking its best it should be re-rhodium plated approximately each 12 to 18 months. \n\n \n\nWhy am I allergic to some gold jewelry? \n\nEvery year we get a few customers who believe that they cannot wear gold jewelry because they get an allergic reaction to it. Some believe that they are allergic to gold. We have never yet known anybody who was allergic to pure gold, and seems very unlikely as gold is inert and not active in the sense of corrosion or decomposition over time, nor is it acidic.\nThe most common cause of allergic reactions to jewelry is nickel contained in the alloy. Nickel is, or was, frequently used in white gold alloys because it is inexpensive, hard, and has a strong whitening effect. Better quality white gold alloys use palladium, which has excellent properties but is more expensive. \n\nCommonest Causes\nThe next commonest cause of allergies for jewelry wearers appears to be detergent or other chemicals which lodge between the jewelry, usually rings, and the skin. Hairdressers are often affected. Rinsing well can help, but it is probably best to remove rings before using any troublesome chemicals, and use a barrier cream. \n\nOther Causes\nA few jewelry wearers still seem to be slightly allergic to yellow gold's, nickel cannot be the cause because it is not used in yellow gold alloys. In most cases sufferers only experience problems with low gold content alloys such as ten carat, so upgrading to a better alloy such as eighteen carat usually solves all problems. \n\nHigher Carat Gold\nThe other common components of ten carat gold alloys are copper, silver and zinc. Zinc is usually very well tolerated, it is used in many medical preparations. Silver and copper do not usually cause allergic reactions, but both will form compounds with atmospheric pollutants which may be the cause of some reported problems. When copper and silver are present in high carat alloy such as eighteen or twenty two carat, they are more resistant to attack by chemicals, because they are bound more closely with the gold content, and this will explain why high carat alloys cause fewer problems. \n\nAnti-Perspirants\nStrange as it may seem, but using anti-Perspirants can exacerbate metal allergy problems. It has been found that the sweat of a healthy person in a sauna can contain 20 times the nickel content of blood plasma, this may help to explain why exercise can improve health. Anti-Perspirants can reduce the bodies natural way of eliminating heavy metals. Healthy natural lifestyles tend to improve health, whereas unnatural practices can cause problems.

Well, most people should learn how to handle money, and learn why credit is really voluntary servitude, but they don't teach that in school, either.\n\nAt some point in time, you have to draw a line about what is proper for the school to teach, and what the parents/family have to teach. Basic hygiene, money matters, religion, etc, are all really the responsibility of the parent, not the school. \n\nOur schools do a rotten enough job trying to teach reading, math, and basic sciences. I don't think they can handle anything else.

Obviously, go to college to be certified to teach history. You will also have to take classes in educational methods, i.e. how to teach. It would be good for you to volunteer with the age group you are interested in teaching while you are in college so you can determine if you really enjoy other people's children enough to spend hours with them every day. What I find most challenging about teaching is keeping myself from getting burnt out from everyone needing something from me all the time. You will need to remember that some students will love history, some will hate it, and most will tolerate it because it is required. You also should consider being certified in a second teaching area, because jobs teaching history are hard to come by. Often districts want teachers who can teach more than one class.

First of all Christians aren't mindless. God doesn't want us to be mindless nor does he want us to have blind faith. He wants us to use our brain and think and question things and make decisions for ourselves. That is why he gave us brains and free will. God wants us to know what we believe and why and as such we must have our eyes wide open in our faith in Him. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. Jesus has never done that either. He would give His opinion and have His say. Anyone forcing their religion or beliefs on someone is in the wrong. Even a Christian who tries to force their opinion on someone is sinning and needs to stop. Yes I will give my opinion on lots of things, especially when I see someone such as you making the comments or posing a question such as you have, but you are free to believe and think what you want. Yet it seems that most of those who are Anti-Christ and Anti-God want to have their say or make rude comments, but not let the Christians have their say. So now you had your say and I had mine and you can take it or leave it. The choice is now yours. John 3:3-6 and Ephesians 2:8-9
Buddy, I don't want to be insulting. 50 states, but the US is one country. Are you proposing Team California, Team Indiana, Team Michigan, Team Rhode Island. That's absurd. 50 states that fall under one Federal Government, one country. Australia has something like six states no? How many provinces does Canada have? They are one country too. So, your aim to create more competition, is the wrong way to go. I don't want to see divided countries.

I like the stupid questions.
The present administration has made a point of campaigning against poverty. President Lula has recieved international applause for his 'Fome Zero' ('Zero Hunger') program.\n\nResearch shows that poverty has decreased 8%, but Brazil still is one of the leaders in the social disparity ranking. We have some of the richest people in the world and quite a lot of the poorest (25,08% of the population lives under the poverty line, which means that their families make under 60 dollars a month).\n\nThe current administration spent over US$13.5 billion in the Fome Zero program this year alone, and that number is growing. There's also Bolsa Familia - a program directed at people whose families make under US$50 a month -, which was classified by The Economist as the largest income transfer program in Latin America, with investments that total over US$3 billion. \n\nAs far as children go, specifically, there's not a lot being done. Our social services have taken care of 1.69 million children, but they only cover about 80% of all counties. \n\nThe problem in the big cities is that most of the poor children that circulate on the streets are not actually homeless. Most of them are sent to beg by their own parents, and some are blatantly used by them to attract sympathy. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has made attempts at gathering 'homeless' kids in special shelters, but they either escape or their parents take them out and let them go to the streets again.\n\nStreet kids are victim of a number of social problems. It is impossible to solve the situation with one specific government program. \n\nPS: to the answer before mine: dude, when you say it's a corrupt society, it sounds like everyone is corrupt. That's not a nice thing to say now, is it?

Well, give it some thought. Why would you consider investing in a foreign country? You would only invest if you feel that:\n\n1. your money would be safe there, and\n2. you would earn a higher return by investing there than you would investing in your own country.\n\nPeople rarely invest as much where they feel the government is unstable or likely to take their assets away. People also rarely invest where the economy is not growing.
If you think about it, Spanish is the second most spoken native language in the world. True English is more widely spoken, but in the future business will shift to Latin America and China. There are 1.2 billion Chinese who speak Chinese and 1.1 Billion people in Latin America. So if you want to be successful, Spanish is a good way of doing so, unless you want to learn Chinese which is the other language I would recommend for you to learn.

Man doesnt have the right. Anyone who has read the Bible knows that. Men like to change what it says to fit their personal beliefs or needs. Sure we dont have the actually scrolls that the authors in the Bible wrote on. But I can only think of one version of the Bible that is closest to the original writings, and thats the King James Version. You can read it, then others and the scriptures dont even have the same meaning anymore. If You're searching for answers from God, and reading his word. Even if it is written in old english. God will speak to your heart and You will understand.

I could not find how many men, but I learned a lot about the 369th Harlem Hellfighter. Here is the information I got from the History Channel. \n\nThe 369th Infantry Regiment of the New York National Guard 15 Regiment. An all African American unit, the 369th fought in World War I under the French Flag because the United States refused to have African American soldiers in combat. The 369th compiled an astounding war record and were decorated by the French government. But when they returned home to the United States, they were subjected to the racism of the era, and discovered their service in World War I meant nothing to their fellow Americans.\n\nI know about the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Co. in the Civil War and the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II. The History Channel shows more other black groups that were fought for our country through out the years.\n\nMy hat goes to these men who fought and died for our freedom.
There are a lot more advantages than disadvantages, of course.\nCrop rotation reduces considerably the risk of extinguishing the naturally grown individuals.\nThese ones are important mostly to preserve technology, creating a small population where certain diseases and plagues can keep living naturally, don't mutate and become resistant to insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.\nLarge crops provide purer fields of the same quality grain/oilseed and at a lot cheaper price so the 6.3 billion people in the world can eat.\nRemember that, crop rotation, crop protection, and selected fertilization make sustainable agriculture.

The degree of association between two variables is shown by the correlation coefficient (r). This can vary from zero for no correlation, to 1 for perfect correlation. Note that this coefficient can be either positive or negative.\n\nThe "significance" of the coefficient, ie the probability of it being due to chance, can be assessed by reference to tables which are available.

Aside from the many societal restraints on the stage, there were also the practical ones which greatly affected how Shakespeare wrote his plays.\n1. Women were not allowed to appear on-stage, therefore young boys would play the female roles. Many of his plays have few female characters, and those that there are often diguise themselves as men.\n2. With no electricity, staging was fairly basic. Characters usually state the location and the time of day so the audience would know what was going on. An entrance from below the stage through the trap door would symbolize one from hell, and from the rafter above would be from heaven.\n3. Each play was performed by just a few actors in the troupe, so each one played many roles.\nand 4. The stage itself was outdoors, with the groundlings standing on the floor right in front of the stage. The upper classes would have seats in the sections above, and the very upper class could pay to sit right on stage. Also, the atmosphere was nothing like the quiet, polite audiences of today. A Shakespeare play has been described as being the Renaissance equivilent of cross between and NBA finals game and a Madonna concert.
Lev 19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I [am] the LORD your God. Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up [any] image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I [am] the LORD your God. \nLev 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. \nDeu 29:17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which [were] among them\n1Ki 15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. \n1Ki 21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all [things] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. \n2Ki 17:12 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
Eminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to "appropriation" under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term "condemnation" is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value).

Sometimes people do this, but it is generally regarded as a bad idea. People who are intending to have careers in the academic world are expected to have training from many different viewpoints, and you can't get different viewpoints if you stay at one place. Unless the place where you studied was undeniably the very best place for that subject, it would be regarded as a negative for you to stay in one place.
Definitely not Bush when he said: "I have never met John Abramoff", then the next day there are dozens of pictures of the two showing up in the press.

It's Shahid Afridi of Pakistan. He has the first and third fastest ODI 100s of all time in 37 and 45 balls. He has two of the four fastest ODI 50s of all time in 18 balls. Also the 9th and 10th fastest test 100s in international cricket.\n\nThe top all time ODI career strike rates are Afridi 108, Dhoni 107 and Blignaut 106.\n\nIf you meant fastest running (rather then fastest scorer) then it would be Inzimum Ul-Haq who was recorded as running a 10 second 100 meter dash to the dessert table during a lunch break.

Most geologists view crude oil, like coal and natural gas, as the product of compression and heating of ancient vegetation over geologic time scales. According to this theory, it is formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric marine animals and terrestrial plants. Over many centuries this organic matter, mixed with dried mud, is buried under thick sedimentary layers of material. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure cause the remains to metamorphose, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. These then migrate through adjacent rock layers until they become trapped underground in porous rocks called reservoirs, forming an oil field, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.

basic MO diagrams only look at one bond at a time, and usually only diatomics.\n\nyou'll have to draw one for the CN triple bond, one for the CC single bond and one for the CC triple bond. it is unlikely that you'll have to do the CH bond, though it can be represented in MO too.\n\npage 24 on this PDF (www.upei.ca/~chem342/Resources/ Reviews/Molecular_Orbital_Tutorial.pdf) shows a MO diagram of CN(-). this will be similar to your case, except one set of lone pairs on the C will be used in the CC single bond...\n\nthis is an odd quesion because normally polyatomics are represented using hybridization...
Our reaction to color is almost instantaneous and has a profound impact on the choices we make everyday. Below is a quick look at general responses to colors based on research, historical significance of color and word association studies. Different cultures react to colors differently and this brief overview focuses on the responses of people in the Western Hemisphere. \n\nRed has more personal associations than any other color. Recognized as a stimulant red is inherently exciting and the amount of red is directly related to the level of energy perceived. Red draws attention and a keen use of red as an accent can immediately focus attention on a particular element. \n\nOrange, a close relative of red, sparks more controversy than any other hue. There is usually strong positive or negative association to orange and true orange generally elicits a stronger “love it” or “hate it” response than other colors. Fun and flamboyant orange radiates warmth and energy. Interestingly, some of the tones of orange such as terra cotta, peach or rust have very broad appeal. \n\nYellow shines with optimism, enlightenment, and happiness. Shades of golden yellow carry the promise of a positive future. Yellow will advance from surrounding colors and instill optimism and energy as well as spark creative thoughts. \n\nGreen occupies more space in the spectrum visible to the human eye and is second only to blue as a favorite color. Green is the pervasive color in the natural world that is an ideal backdrop in interior design because we are so used to seeing it everywhere. The natural greens, from forest to lime, are seen as tranquil and refreshing, with a natural balance of cool and warm (blue and yellow) undertones. Green is considered the color of peace and ecology. However, there is an “institutional” side to green, associated with illness or Government-issued that conjure up negative emotions as do the “slimy” or bilious greens. \n\nBlue is the overwhelming “favorite color.” Blue is seen as trustworthy, dependable and committed. The color of sky and the ocean, blue is perceived as a constant in our lives. As the collective color of the spirit, it invokes rest and can cause the body to produce chemicals that are calming; however not all blues are serene and sedate. Electric or brilliant blues become dynamic and dramatic, an engaging color that expresses exhilaration. Some shades or the overuse of blue may come across as cold or uncaring. Blue is the least “gender specific” color, having equal appeal to both men and women. \n\nPurple embodies the balance of red simulation and blue calm. This dichotomy can cause unrest or uneasiness unless the undertone is clearly defined at which point the purple takes on the characteristics of its undertone. A sense of mystic and royal qualities, purple is a color often well liked by very creative or eccentric types and is the favorite color of adolescent girls. \n\nBrown says stability, reliability, and approachability. It is the color of our earth and is associated with all things natural or organic. \n\nGray is timeless, practical, and solid. A longstanding favorite suit color, gray can mix well with any color. Although well like and often worn, people rarely name gray as a favorite color possibly because Gray also is associated with loss or depression. \n\nBlack is authoritative and powerful; because black can evoke strong emotions too much can be overwhelming. A classic color for clothing possibly because it makes the wearer appear thinner and more sophisticated. \n\nWhite projects purity, cleanliness, and neutrality. Doctors don white coats, brides traditionally were white gowns and a white picket fence surrounds a safe and happy home.

Well some people would say why would you limit yourself to half the candy in the box!\n\nBut there have actually been studies of men who think of themselves as bisexual as far as what gets them aroused, and nearly all of the men in the study had s distinct preference as far as what they reacted to. And most in the study who said they were Bi responded more positively to females, although a few seemed to prefer men.\n\nThe same study was performed on heterosexual and gay males and they found that the heterosexuals became more aroused when presented with images of women and gay men tended to react much more strongly to men, as you would expect.\n\nIn my experience women who are bi get a much warmer reception (except among lesbians) and men who are are sometimes shunned by both Gay and Straight people. \n\nI will try to find an article about the study and post it below.

yes, you could have Irritable Bowl Sndrome. I have it and it took us 5 months to figure out! Your doctor would probably want a colonoscopy done, and I warn you they make you drink this nasty laxitive that will clear out whatever is left in your colon. You will only be able to drink clear liquid the day before, broth, popscicles, jello that sort of thing but nothing red because it can temporarly stain the colon and make the doctor think you have internal bleeding. They generally knock you completly out and you may be a bit sore after words but its worth it to make sure you don't have something worse.\nPlease cut back on drinking too, it could be causing it and you will get liver problems in the future if you don't slow down! \nGood luck

I am assuming that you are using Windows XP (with out without the service packs)\nThe best way is to use the Windows "File and Settings transfer wizard. Find this under Start->All Programs->Accessories->System tools->Files and Settings Transfer Wizard. This will help you to transfer your files and most of the windows settings. However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.\n\nFollow these steps\n1. Run the wizard in your old computer. If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option. Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\n\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk. Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\n\n3. Start the new computer and run the tool again.

His understudy was van der Gouw.\n\n- Schmeichel's successor was Bosnich.\n- Nick Culkin (not Rachubka) played 10 seconds or so in a game against Arsenal after van der Gouw got injured during the match. Bosnich was injured before the game.\n- Fergie then brought in Taibi, and you know what happened\n\nNext season, he bought Fabian Barthez. Bosnich was let go, and Roy Carroll was his understudy now. Andy Goram had a short spell too.\n\nAfter Barthez left came Tim Howard. Carroll continued to be backup.\n\nThen we now have van der Sar, plus Kuzczack(?) as understudy. Carroll was released, and Howard left on loan.\n\nThat's about 10 then.\n\nEDIT: I forgot Ricardo. Third choice Spainard who had a couple of games.
Well mosquitoes play a huge role in their interactions with humans. One specie called of mosquito carries Malaria. Did you know that Malaria is the number killer in the world today? Without mosquitoes perhaps there would be a lot more people living a lot longer. I'm not saying the mosquitoes purpose is to hold population in check or anything. I only assert that they aren't just a nuisance, they have a big role in the world!
a 17" riser would be like stepping up a flight of stairs made out of piano benches. 7-5/16" is a more standard riser height. I would guess that you need a quantity of 17 risers, each at a height of 7-5/16". That gives you a floor to floor distance of 10'4", which is a reasonable distance between two floors of a house/residence/etc. The question to ask your architect or draftsman is "how deep are the treads?"\n\nMore basically, the riser is the piece of the stair that is vertical, and the tread is the piece of the stair that is horizontal. Floor-to-floor measurements are often made from finished surface to finished surface of two storeys/stories of a house. Building codes typically require that continuous runs of stairs all have the same riser height and tread depth, within a tolerance of usually less than 1/2 inch. without this, we'd all be living in Willy Wonka houses and tripping up and down the stairs all the time.
Germany ran out of men and supplies,with riots at home and a Communist uprising.The Kaiser abdicated and the German government surrendered to the Allies.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire also surrendered and was broken into smaller states.(Austria,Hungary,Czechoslovakia,etc)\nThe Turkish Empire surrendered and was also dismantled.
The north had more rivers that were suitable for generating power. Additionally, the ground in the south was far more profitable for farming than for mining.\n\nVast northern coal and iron mines interconnected through expansive and inexpensive water ways .... \n\nMake sense ? In the south, because of the rich soil and longer growing season, it was simply more profitable to put plants in the ground rather than on top of them -- sort of a pun there\n\n;-)

In the Marine Corps your promotion to E4 and E5 is based on your composite score and your MOS's cutting score. Your composite score is based on your pro's and con's and your PFT score and rifle score. They also give you points for how long you've been in and how long you've been at the rank you are. To get promoted to E6 you have to have been an E5 for at least 2 years before you are eligible to pick up (unless it is a field (combat) promotion)then it is up to recommendations from your SNCO's and up.

Waivers are the place where players go after someone drops them. Depending upon how long the waiver time is set, they remain on waivers for at least that long. If more than one person claims them while they are on waivers (before they become a free agent), then whoever has the best waiver priority number gets the player.

no.are you really from India . thats so cool.
You are right about that! No one feels that they do anything wrong given their frame of reference of the world. Anyone can seem to justify their actions, even if it's only to themselves.
hmm, it just depends. could you call ahead and ask the hotels if they'll have free wireless? as the person ahead of me said, many of them offer free wireless. and if not there might be a library or something around where you can sign on. there's got to be somewhere you can sign online. practically everyone's connected now!
You pretty much answered your question. Go to the doctor.
You can create one at myspace.com if ya want to. It's easy.
you need to see if you are required to file a fed return. Go to IRS.GOV in the key words box type in filling requirements.If you don't have to file a US return than don't. But if you pd in taxes you might want to so you can get the money you pd in back! I don't know if Canada wants all the income you made or not.You will have to find out

Friend, \n\nIf we give you one problem, the way you split and derive the answer is called analytical skills. It is the term which will tell the employers that you are capable of solving problems. MAths is the basic for this and for any operation invovled. If you are good at maths you can solve a problem. \n\nNow say who likes a person who takes hours to tell answer for an multiplication of 255 * 255
is 1410/2400 (all three scores) or 1410/1600 (just your CR and math) ??? that makes all the difference

"M&M's" candies were first marketed by Forrest Mars Sr. and R. Bruce Murrie. They used the first initial of both of their last names, and the apostrophe "s" denotes their ownership of the idea and the trademark rather than the fact that there are more than one in a bag.
You have a right to be angry. He is saying he doesn't want to be around you for 24 hours and I understand that but being around you 1-2 days out of the month is just not right or fair. He also said that he is tired of you. Doesn't sound good for a man to say to a woman he's about to marry. Does he plan to keep this up even when you all are married? I applaud him for working but he needs to balance it out (work and family). Honestly, I think there is something wrong with this picture. He only comes around you 1-2 days out of the month and his mom has your car! That is not your problem that his mom doesn't have a car. Since he is working so much, he should help her get a car and his mom appears to be inconsiderate. Get your car back and maybe work out something where you can take her to where ever she has to go whenever you can. His mom will probably never get a car because she has yours. If she is going to use your car, she should only use it for places she HAS to go only. I suggest you seriously think about your plans to marry this guy. I understand you love him and all, but marriage is a lot of work and if he's never around, how do you all plan to spend any time together which is a big part of marriage. I believe I have answered your questions, but yes he (and his mom) is being very inconsiderate and you all need to really talk and figure out if you 2 should marry. Good Luck.
because people needed something to believe in. I don't think people on here are going to be very happy with my explaination but I personally feel it was started/written to oppress women. Is it a coincidence that all the women in the bible, with the exception of Mary, were whores and evil sinners? When it said in the bible that because we are women we can't serve the lord in the same way a man could...what's that about? Christianity has been oppressing women for years and I believe that was their intended future when they started the religion. Sorry if I offend anyone. \n\nFYI ~ I was raised a catholic and went to catholic school so I have heard everything you will say in response to my explaination.

Unlike Christians, who try to force the Bible down your throat, Atheists don't really care what you believe in, as long as you don't try to push your beliefs at others. \n\nIf you want my advice, your perfectly fine as it is. Humans don't need a "God" to make themselves feel better. Having God in your life only makes you more dependent and weaker. It's your life; it's up to you to live your life and be happy. You're the only one who can make a difference in your life.
I truly believe that George Bush is standing up for what he believes in: freedom for all people. There is nothing worse than living under the tyranny of a dictator.\n\nBoth of my parents lived through that in WWII and fled their countries. When you lose your home, you job, have no food, water, clothes because your "dictator" is taking over everything, you cherish freedom more.\n\nI happen to Thank GOD everyday for the freedoms I have. And I totally respect President Bush for what he is doing to free those people who have no voice of their own. \n\nBy the way, have you seen these pictures of those thanking President Bush? (of course you haven't, the news never show them) Click on the links, you'll see that these people are very grateful for their freedom.\n\nhttp://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asenger/Crew%20Only/Thank%20You%20Mr%20Bush.jpg\n\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~brianhuard/thank_you_america.JPG\n\nhttp://www.exmuslim.com/free3.jpg\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/29/wafg129.xml

a cool magic trick i know is if you take a straight strip of paper and fold it in half "hamburger style" then bend it back to where its about a 90 degree angle and place a coin over the bend, grab both ends and slowly pull outward, unfolding the paper, when it is pulled tight the coin will be perfectly balanced on the edge of the paper
Yeah you can do that. Teachers are getting very good at catching these papers. You can be kicked out of school for using one. Don't risk it.
The DSN you get back should tell you why it failed (address doesn't exist etc) if you look at the message or possibly in the attachment it sends back. Their are various forms usually its because the address your trying to send to doesn't exist. \n\nThe other thing you get is delayed which is their is problem with the server your trying to send to, or a server on route to the one your sending to. Usually if its delayed for two days it gets sent back as failed. If your really really really really sure that the address is correct and that you typed it in correctly send an email to the postmaster of your internet provider. So say your using AOL it would be postmaster@aol.com or say your using BOG it would be postmaster@bog.com telling them your having trouble sending it to such and such an address. \n\nBut as I said chances are its something your typing in thats wrong as apposed to something wrong with the way its forwarded. Don't piss off the postmaster (s)he a busy person so only use it if your really sure its something wrong with the mail system.

Hey! Thanks for mentioning the term KBO, I had very faint memories of the topic and your mention refreshed my memory. To again remind myself all about Kuiper Belt Objects, I went here-\nhttp://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Kuiper+belt&curtab=2222_1&linktext=Kuiper%20belt\n\nNow, I am back to answer your question loaded with my thoughts and ideas. Here is what I reckon-\nAccording to the recent observations, it has been proved without the shadow of doubt that Pluto is a KBO. But, it is still unclear that whether it is a large asteroid or a planet due to its smaller size. \n\nBut again, that is another thing because, a heavenly body can be a KBO and a planet at the same time. It can also be a satellite and a KBO at the same time. Consider the moon of Neptune which was a KBO and now is a satellite of Naptune.\n\nSo, we can say that although Pluto falls in the Kuiper belt. It doesn't have an effect on its being an asteroid or a planet although, if it were discovered right now, it is most likely that scientists won't call it a planet. But, Because, it is orbiting the sun even as a KBO and is no different from any body in the solar system. The main point of discussion regarding this is whether it is a Planet or an asteroid? Due to its size, it is often considered an intermediate between a planet and an asteroid. Scientists may argue about this topic but, it doesn't hold that much significance as it is only the size that is point of debate & it can be considered either a planet or a huge asteroid.\n\nWell, to view the ongoing debate on this topic, visit these sites-\n1] Yes, Pluto really is a planet\nhttp://www.lowell.edu/users/buie/pluto/planet.html\n\n2] Is Pluto a Planet, an Asteroid, or...?\nhttp://mips.as.arizona.edu/~stansber/Planet.html\n\n3] Is Pluto a real planet, or just a large asteroid?

Drink more water and above all STOP DRINKING SODA.\n\nTo lose weight constantly and to keep it off, you have to change your life.

You must eat mostly vegetables, whole grains & fruits and very little fats, salts and sugars.

Not sure about KY, but in AL and most other places indictments are handed down from a grand jury who usually hear evidence regarding felonies and determine whether or not there is enough evidence/probable cause to believe the accused has committed a crime.

The ultimate question for you to ask before taking the LSAT (I am not sure about the LNAT) is if you do well on a standard exam. If you are good at it, you will very much likely succeed in getting high scores and in law school and the bar exam later on. My mentor who sat on the bar review commission told me there's a strikingly high correlation between the LSAT score, and the law school performance and the bar exam. \n\nHaving said that, if you are not good at it, the best you can do is to learn how to approach the standard exams. And I want to remind you that being a poor standard exam taker is not insurmountable to overcome this. However, you have to know how and follow exactly what I tell you here. Here is how: The most important thing is when you practice by solving the problems, make sure you always time them. The next important thing is once again, time them. Next thing you have to worry about is .... you got the idea by now -- time them!!!!\n\nRemember also it is a game that most of us have the ability to do well. But I have seen way too many people caught up with notion that you have to get all the questions right. You should have no problem solving about a half of the problems correctly before you begin practicing them.

C'est Mido (ex-joueur de l'om) dans un match de l'Egypte lors de la coupe d'afrique des nations. Je crois que son vrai nom est Mohamed Hassan.
A 17-year old boy holds a hospital hostage because he wants them to save his sister who is dying from lung cancer. He only wants a certain doctor, who is not there, and they can't find. Matt talks with the boy on the phone as Emily goes on a mission to find the missing doctor who appears to have dropped over the face of planet. They show flashbacks of Matt when he was a little boy, running through a hospital. It turns out when he was younger, his mother, who was a cop, was shot and later died in the hospital. Matt tells MJ (the boy) that he hates hospitals and he knows what he's going through. Emily finally tracks down the doctor who tells her he doesn't work for terrorists and won't come with her. She later convinces him to come and they arrive just in time before the SWAT team attempts to take MJ out. After MJ gives himself up and the doctor takes a look at his sister, he tells MJ there is no chance she'll survive, only lasting maybe 1 or 2 months. They cuff MJ and go to take him away but Matt uncuffs him and tells him to spend his last moments with his sister before she dies. \n\nIt was a pretty good episode in my opinion. I loved how Matt related with MJ. Matt was getting emotional when talking to him (not crying or anything, just angry) and he could really relate to MJ.

Most likely because they confuse faith with science and have trouble reconciling the two. Science, by definition, makes statements that can be tested. Faith doesn't require proof. As a scientist, I can look at the evidence that supports evolution and recognize that it makes sense and has yet to be disproved. I can look at the idea of intelligent design and say "That's not science, because it can't be tested. Belief in that idea is based on faith, not scientific proof." This does not, however, interfere with my belief in a higher power. Science tells us how we got here, Faith tells us what we're supposed to do now that we're here.

I will tell you right now I have the cure for psoriasis and my wife figured it out! I will even send you pics to back it up. Guess yet? Tanning salon...yes I'm serious. My wife had is so bad that it covered 50% of her whole body (she tried everything!!!) and she started going to the tanning salon to build her tan so she could go swimming in the pool come summer and after 3 weeks of going 3 times a week for ten to fifteen minutes at a time you couldn't hardly see it anymore. I was amazed! Now you can't see any trace of it at all. Her mom was the same way. She asked a doctor and said that they use a somewhat similar treatment called light therapy. If your's is the kind that gets a little better in summer (if you go out) then this should help. Don't over do it cause tanning salons can be bad if you do too much and let the employees guide you into builing your tan slowly. My wife is going to be so happy I shared this with you. If it works then look me up and answer one of my current questions at the time with your story. GOOD LUCK!!!

There are what we call "junk debt buyers" which are rouge debt collectors that buy debt long past the statute and illegally re-age the accounts and sue or try to collect them far after the statute has expired. \n\nBased on your situation, you may have no choice but to file, but your should still look at your alternatives because bankruptcy should be a last resort. \n\n\nHere is a good article on bankruptcy facts you should read: \n\nhttp://www.expert-credit-advice.com/bankruptcy_facts.htm\n\n\n\nHere is a good artcle about options to deal with debt: \n\nhttp://www.expert-credit-advice.com/options_to_eliminate_debt.htm \n\n\nWhatever you decide to do, it will affect your credit. \n\nIf you want it to affect your credit positively, pay off your debts without bankruptcy. Settling your debts may allow you to afford paying them off rapidly and you can still salvage your credit but it will take some time. \n\nRead this: http://www.expert-credit-advice.com/debt_settlement_service.htm
Bonds are debts of a company or a state. They pay interest rates once per year or quarter. They are less risky than stocks, as long as you buy them and hold them until they expire.\n\nHowever, bond prices fluctuate, inversely with interest rate.\n\nAlso, the company which issued the bonds can go bankrupt, after which their debt becomes worthless. State issued bonds do not have this problem. In principle a gouvernment can always increases taxes to pay-off the bonds.

Otherwise, you have to use intermediares.\n\nThe question is which one? The only ones are those who can count on doing continuous business with you. They may ask for big fees and it also depends on the amount. Ask the receiver how it could be done.
Hello Friend! \n Let us see a small example. If we are in a moving bus, the trees on the road side appear to be moving fastly in the opposite direction. Even though that the trees are at rest, they appear to move. This is due to the special theory of relativity. \n Even though that the earth is rotating with large velocity, the objects stay on the earth. The centripetal and centrifugal forces are responsible for the objects to stay on the earth in rest condition.

You realize that it is up to you now to make yourself happy. It is up to you to make decisions now and they can be just exactly what you want to do and not have to worry about pleasing anyone else. You realize that you have goals to make and that you are going to start with the easy ones and work your way up, because nothing is going to stand in your way now. You realize that you are stronger than to dwell in self pitty and that making the best of each day will bring you closer to what you really want in life.\n\nWhile separation can be devastating it also needs to be a learning experience. Let yourself blossom form this and come out smelling better because of it. This is your life now.\n\nIt is up to you now. You can do it.

Yeah, I've noticed that too. Here's a disgusting thought. Just think if someone gathered up all those pubes and put em in a big pile. It would probably fill a freakin' stadium up. But, I digress on to why theres more. Dudes scratch themselves more, maybe scratchin those hairs loose. Also dudes stand up to pee so bam they fall right on the urinal. Alot of women shave so on average, less pubes. and since the ladies sit to do evertything if they are losing pubes there going right in the water. Well thats my two cents.
to a degree yes they used to be considered so - as the italian gal is probably catholic. the two religions were considered like to different ethincities.\n\none thing i would warn him about -- generally ethnic familied have lots of traditions and such -- as a WASP he may or may not have them - generally not so.... he will need to know that these family traditions are as important as the family itself.

Data entry, specifically for medical records, is one of the target areas for fraudulent businesses. Many companies promise a work-at-home environment and an ease of finding work, all you need to do is buy their high-priced software. What they don't tell you is that the majority of doctor offices send out their records to industry-based data entry services.\n\nI would suggest that you go to the Federal Trade Commissions website and review their articles concerning home-based businesses and scams. It will help you discern fraudulent companies from legitimate ones.

This is a great question and it has nothing to do with bleeding heart liberals or any political bashing.\n\nUnfortunately what happens usually when someone is arrested and then questioned by the police they are not read their rights on purpose. Because the un-written rule is whatever the accused says prior to being read their rights is considered a spontaneous comment. As soon as the accused ask for an attorney all questioning is suppose to stop. If it continues anything said after and before that point is inadmissable in court. \n This is where coercion comes to play. The accused can say he was coerced into signing the confession. Which in many cases happens. Some police officers get anxious to solve the case. Most police officers have the best intentions of the victims in mind. But by not following the law and rules or knowing how to write a report they end up hurting the victim. Because now the accused can get off on technicalities caused by the investigation of the police. Does this make sense?\n\nThe victim can pursue a civil law suit against the accused also. A civil law suit is mostly for damages which means money for the victim. A criminal court is for punishment. Sometime you can collect damages while they are in prison or jail. For instance if the judge states the accused must pay restitution then any money he receives from family, friends or whatever while incarcerated will go to the victim.\n\nAs far as victim's rights. Well it is a lowsy program. There are victims rights groups out there. Ask the nearest probation office where they are so your friend can get some help. The victim's rights groups would be the bleeding heart liberals you are being told to stay away from.\n\nI am truly sorry for the pain you and your daughter are going through. You probably here it all the time to get counseling. But how does counseling really help such a violation. I can only tell you how the system works.

Hopefully the DA will pursue this and put this guy behind bars. \n\nI have an old friend from the service whose daughter was murdered at 18 yrs old. My son and her grew up together.

Something The Bush Administration doesn't have.
In a fracture, the tooth is split into two or more fragments, one attached to the socket and one free. The Ellis classification system is used to describe crown fractures. \nAn Ellis class I fracture involves only the enamel and is rarely painful. \nAn Ellis class II fracture is an enamel and dentin fracture that leaves dentin exposed; pain or sensitivity depends on the degree of exposure. \nAn Ellis class III fracture involves enamel and dentin, with pulp and nerve exposure. The tooth involved in an Ellis class III fracture may be sensitive and may be contaminated by bacteria normally found in the mouth.4 An Ellis class III fracture may result in pulp death and may cause serious sequelae, including infection, abscess.\n\nAs tooth fracture relates to prosthodontics and VD; the more time that goes by between fracture of the tooth and restoration the harder it is to restore because of tooth extrusion or vertical collapse in extreme cases. Other wise there are no serious immediate consequences, that I can see.

Certainly this young man should suffer consequences for interrupting your performance. Whether your performance is as a club or as an athletic team (as the cheer squad at your school), he has no right to disrupt the pep assembly in that manner. \n\nYes, it was an insult to your group. Yes, you are compatible/equal to the cheerleaders. Many schools' dance teams started out as yours is doing: as an informal/intra-mural "club"/after-school activity and grew into a teacher/school-sponsored activity that is "legitimate" and eventually competes against other schools in inter-scholastic competition. \n\nUnfortunately, the punishment that he receives is not up to you and your group members. My suggestion to you would be to have your parents contact the administration and have THEM explain your and their frustration and disapoointment that another student would disrupt a performance of fellow students. The parents of the dance group should also say that they expect some form of punishment that is somewhat severe for this young fellow since this is the second year in a row he has interrupted a pep rally. They should also emphasize how demoralizing it is for their daughters to have to experience this type of humiliation in front of the whole student body, when their daughters are trying to expose their fellow students to dance and rhythm. \n\nYou are not whacked -- he is!\n\nGood luck...

try as best you can to get your boyfriend out of the equation. i would suggest staying at least until the end of the semester, and then think about transferring. it's still early. i know you want to be with him, but things can change and going to the same school doesn't guarantee happiness. \ni'm sure your school has plenty to offer you; you just have to look in the right places. explore a little more, expand your horizons. don't forget about your boyfriend, of course, but see if you can keep your mind on other things.\nit's entirely possible that your school isn't right for you. but you need to give it a fair chance.
No, I would not defend my religion IF my religion was proven wrong. It serves no purpose to stick with something that is not right. Unless of course you like it that way. Everyone has that choice though. Personally, I would convert if I found something else to be right.

Do you know what it took to even ask the question? You have a physical machine called a body that is able to use its mind to ponder the question, relay visual information from a physical world of comparable low-tech computers through the optic nerve, into the brain, with the mind to comprehend the ramifications, then transfer that thought process to an incredibly complex systems of nerves, tendons, and touch to the fingers to type the letters. This then communicates a question of the soul. The soul is something that science cannot a.) explain and b.) create. It can only mimic with unsatisfactory results. That soul is concerned for the existence of an eternal destiny beyond time and space--that there is a world beyond the physical world we see in the here and now. You are an incredible creation who has been given the free will choice to believe, or not believe. A being that can love, write poetry, paint or play works of incredible complexity and beauty. To smell, and taste, enjoy. So, like you, I set out on a path to find my Creator. It is obvious that He exists, but is He personal or an impersonal force? My answer came through the study of prophecy in the Bible. Like the DNA strand and life itself, it was hard to dispute the evidence. Now with the realization of the truth of the Bible, God made it clear that He was not only a personal God, but One who wanted to know ME, and that He knew everything about me--even the number of every hair on my head.\n\nEphesians 3\nFor this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height-- to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

Your basic selection criteria start with flow rate @ pressure. This is going to depend on what you are trying to do, but you will find a direct correlation between the horsepower input of the pump motor and the combination of flow at pressure. Note that it is possible to make low flow at high pressure, or low pressure at high flow, but it takes a lot of power to both.\n\nA suggestion is to calculate the amount of power your require (force X distance / unit of time) and convert that to horsepower, then look for an HPU at www.Grainger.com that is about 2X that horsepower.
Testicular cancer is a rare disease in men caused by abnormal growth of cells of the testicle.

Each testicle (or testis) produces sperm.\n\n\nThe male pelvis\n\nCancer\nThe building blocks of the body are tiny cells, which normally repair and reproduce in a controlled process. With cancer, this process goes wrong and cells can divide and grow in an uncontrolled way, causing a lump on or within the part of the body affected. If this tumour contains cells that are able to invade neighbouring tissues or organs, it is known as malignant. If the tumour does not do this, it is termed benign.

I think the point they were trying to make at the end of the movie was what Evey, and essentially V, did at the end blowing up Parliament was for everyone dead and alive. If you noticed at the end, the cop asked her who he was and she was said that he was her mother, her father, brother, her, and the cop. That's why they showed Gordon, her mother, and her brother at the end. He sort of represented the people, only before he came along people were scared to speak up against their government, but after he went on TV and challenged everyone to think, that's when they started to agree with him. This was my interpretation. Hope this helps.

A test is valid when it measures what it is supposed to. It is reliable it yields consistent results. You find out more at:\nhttp://www.georgetown.edu/departments/psychology/researchmethods/researchanddesign/validityandreliability.htm\n\nThe disadvantages of using secondary data:\nYou do not have the control over how the instrument is designed, how they are collected, or how carefully they are manipulated and documented. Another serious trade-off between primary and secondary data is the issue of anomalies; when you are using data you have collected yourself, you have a clear understanding of how those data should appear (in a frequency table, for example). You are more quickly able to spot and correct those anomalies. If you are using someone else's data, you won't necessarily know all of the subtleties that were involved in making coding decisions and in inputting the data.\nhttp://ed.isu.edu/research/Procedures/DataType.htm

Ignore the goofball who told you the 7 years starts when you payoff the account, that is wrong.

If the date is incorrect you can dispute it.\n\nNever ask a collector anything, they have no interest in helping you and often try to get you to send them even a partial payment which will allow them to re-age your account so it shows up for ANOTHER 7 years on your credit report. \n\nOften collectors will try to collect on debt that is so old that it is beyond the statute of limitations for your state and is legally unenforceble debt.

Interesting observation. \nI would quibble that these folks who constantly cite some Biblical or Koranic verse as "proof" of their positions or opinions are poor, literal-minded saps who think their fairy tale is the bestest of fairy tales. \nFrankly, while the Internet is a great media for community-building, it is not, and probably never can be, very good for obtaining "facts", since any search (Yahoo, Google or other) is likely to provide both genuine information and apocryphal doodoo masquerading as the straight dope.\nThus, while I too find those quotatious responders curious and perhaps pathetic, the very presence of the\n "Know your source? List it here:" \nbox on the response page is an invitation to the practice.\nI do hope we won't start believing that the Internet is our new Holy Book, but we probably will (sigh). \n\nAfter all, it's already capitalized.

As stated above, "good" is relative.\n\nTake an inventory of your life and determine what your priorities are. Then, methodically aim to accomplish those goals.\n\nFor example, to me, the "good life" is the goal of a home I build to my specifications that is handicapped accessible and totally paid for by the time I retire that can also be as economical as I can build it. I also want enough money saved that I can do a little traveling and buy books and simple pleasures without a lot of effort.\n\nI don't care about Hollywood-type glamor or owning a hige home with lots of things.\n\nI know what I want and I have a plan to get it. To me that is the "good life".

Let's start with the basics. The solution is based on a Windows XP operating system.\n\n1) Check to see that the speakers are plugged into the computer correctly. Make sure they are connected to the proper output.\n\n2) Check to see if there is power to the speakers. If your speakers have no power, there's your problem.\n\n3) Open your control panel. Go to Sounds and Audio Devices. Make sure the sounds are not muted. If the mute button is checked, uncheck it.\n\n4) Also, while in Sounds and Audio devices, open the Audio tab. Check to see if there is a default device. Make sure it is the correct one by changing it and testing your system.\n\n5) If that doesn't work, go to the Hardware Tab (also in sounds and Audio) and try the troubleshoot button.\n\n6) Make sure your audio driver is installeed, and up to date.\nIf this doesn't help, please edit the question with more informtion such as if the problem exists onkly when you run certain programs, what operating system you have, what computer you have (make and model), and anything info you can provide.\n\nHope this helps.

yea, as with what everyone else said thus far, here's another fact: one of the substitute sugars they've been inserting in low calorie/diet foods and drinks, I think the Amphet..somethingsomething, isn't even digestable to us humans. It's a total manufactured chemical that our bodies are no knowledge or digestive bacteria to properly digest it. Therefore, it is not good for you. I'd say diet sodas are worse than regular sodas, period. If you want a soda, drink a regular. Otherwise, here's another fact: you can lose an average 10lbs in one year just by cutting soda out of your diet completely. Think about that. The shet is useless to begin with.
Yes! Any Historic house will ALWAYS be a good investment. Obviously these types of houses aren't being made anymore for various reasons. First off, the manner in which these older buildings were built is no longer economically feasible. It costs way too much to build new houses with real wood and brick, as a result you see a lot of fiberboard and cheaper building materials being used in new house construction. When a new home is built, they cut many, many corners compared to how an older home was built. You've probably heard the old adage that "They don't build them like they used to". In this case it's very true! Also most older homes are made with trees from what are known as "old growth forests" instead of "new growth forests". "Old growth" wood is substantially stronger, more rugged, and even harder than "new growth" wood. Wood producers have practical run out of "old growth" (from older, mature forests) and what little is left is a lot more expensive than the more common, and softer "new growth' woods (from newer, non-mature forests). Older homes as a result are built from much better, longer lasting materials. Next, let's talk about architecture. The style of the house is a product of the time during which it was built. Naturally, as times have changed so have the styles of newer buildings. What I'm trying to get at is that older homes are time capsules of bygone eras! In the same way that antique furniture is highly sought after and prized, so too will older, historical homes be sought after and prized (if the haven't been already). Older homes are rarer and harder to come by, and so over time should be worth considerably more than newer homes. Older homes, closer to the center of a town (downtown), usually go through what is known as "GENTRIFICATION" at some point. Please google, er um, I mean yahoo this term. All older neighborhoods experience gentrification at some point, the main question is WHEN! If your lucky enough to own the property before gentrification hits you'll be able to ride the wave of prosperity that it'll create (as well as the higher property tax bill)! Georgia is no exception when it comes to gentrification. By the way, just so you know I practice what I preach. I live in a 90 year old beauty in an older San Antonio neighborhood just north of downtown. My property's value has DOUBLED in the last five due to a renewed interest in the area (gentrification). Why, the property's value has increased 10% in the first quarter of 2006 alone! \n\n Rentals are almost always serious money producers. If you have 3-5 units and if you play it right, your tenants can pay off most of your mortgage for you! On my property, the car garage in the back was converted into a small apartment by the previous owners. I collect enough rent from the person I leased it out to, to pay for 3/4s of my mortgage payment! Rentals are definitely good!\n \n As to what one should look for, I'd say that the basics are important. Make sure that the foundation of the house is solid, since foundation repairs can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair. Make sure that the electrical wiring has been updated (a definite must), that the plumbing is in good repair, and that the roof is in good shape, that the A/C and heating works well, etc. Basicly, you don't want to buy a house that needs more repairs than it's worth. Also look to see what's around your neighborhood that would help to improve the quality of life of anyone who live there. Are there lots of restaurants, shopping centers, parks, museums, movie theaters, librarys, schools, colleges, etc. In my case there are three universities nearby, two city parks, and plenty of shopping centers and restaurants. I hope this has helped you.

"luctari" means to wrestle or to struggle.\nSo the Latin verb (luctari) is in the passive voice. No active voice exists in Latin for this verb. Yet it translates into English verbs in active voice (to wrestle, to struggle).\n\nHence, "luctantur" means "they wrestle" or "they struggle", not "they were wrestled" or "they were struggled".\n\nThere is no "luctant" in Latin, only "luctantur". Some verbs in Latin are just like that. They use only the passive form but have active meaning. So to translate them you just use active voice as if it didn't worry you one bit why the Ancient Romans chose to use these verbs in this way. ;)
It would make your face mask all greasy. And how would you get it from the box to your mouth? You'd have to go back to the lunar lander every time you wanted another piece, take of your helmet, stuff it inside where it would dribble cheese all over you and you'd have sauce going down your suit. Why can't you sit inside and eat it while looking out the window at the flag?

That sounds horrible! If she has been diagnosed with an STD, it is reported to the Department of Health. If she knowingly infects someone else and they become infected; they MAY be able to take legal action only if they have proof it was from her. This is difficult because you cannot always prove "when" you were infected. Tell your friend to go to the doctor and seek treatment. Most STDs are curable, but if left untreated many side effects including infertility can occur.
A clone is a clone basically. They're all made in a similar fashion so there's no real discernable difference from any of them. I purchased a Nike clone set from Golf Components Plus I believe was their name. It was abotu 4 years ago. Anyhoo, it's a really nice set and I have no complaints or problems with them. They're modeled after the Nike muscleback blades, the first set they ever came out with. Obviously not forged but cast but the feel and playability is still there. gives you a good "feel" for the real thing. I've known a couple of companies like Warrior Custom (Total Bulls*hit) Dynacraft and Golfsmith are very good. Don't know if you would classify them as clones makers but still make very nice clubs. The clubs I have are muscleback irons so it's kind of hard to find anyone, clone makers, that carry them. as far as your regular clubs, they also have some decent ones as well.
A criminal history is not necessarily a disqualifier when trying to join the military although as you said it will require a waiver. Technically even if your history is expunged you are required by law to disclose it on the military application papers. Your best bet is to work with a recruiter although obviously some serious offenses are disqualifying. Also if any of your offenses are related to domestic violence they are disqualifying.\n\nThe MEPs station does not do a very thorough job checking your teeth. They do a vision screening although I am not sure what the situations are where they would disqualify someone.\n\nAs a side note I would encourage you to ignore frank_ramirez_81. Clearly he is ignorant as to the army/military and how it works.\n\nThe majority of troops are middle class and indeed lower class. He would probably reserect that tired argument that lower class minorities are forced by their situation to join the military. As someone from that background (Lower Class) I can say unequivocally that this is false. There are opportunities out there for anyone who wants them. I attended college before joining the military for example. There are dozens if not hundreds of programs out there for those who wish to succeed. The military is just one option.\n\nAs to his statement, "You know that by joining you will be sent to Iraq right?"\n\nThat is possible but increasingly less likely. I've been in for a while now and have tried on numerous occassions to volunteer to go down range. Foolish perhaps but something many of us in the military want to do. The long and the short of it is that despite my efforts I've not met with success. Of course if you were to pick a combat arms branch (Infantry, Armour, Calvary etc.) the likelyhood is much greater.\n\nAnyone ignore Frank and people like him. Talk to a recruiter if you want to get in they will likely find a way.

UVB rays are needed for your skin to produce vitamin D, but it also stimulates melanocytes to darken your skin, which allows less UVB rays in. Vitamin D created by your skin and from diet is activated by the liver and kidneys, then stimulate increased absorption of calcium through in the intestines. Prior to fortification of milk with vitamin D, there was a higher occurrence of rickets amount people of darker complexion and people who didn't get enough sun exposure.

Bring it up to them, and ask them why exactly are they doing that to you? If they are not understanding what you are talking about. Then explain to them what your feelings are, and tell them if they keep doing it, that your going to stop hanging out with them. If you have already told them your feelings, then stop hanging out with them and let them see that your serious about your feelings. A true friend is not going to do that kind of stuff anyways.
No, absoutely not. The arguement for it will be to keep the middle east stable, and if anything the past few years have shown that to be an impossible goal. The concern is that if things go down in flames over their, it will create a shambles of the US economy and lifestyle, and a major redistribution of wealth with many people loosing, both rich and poor, and a potential destabilization of our own government.\n\nI think that attitude is selling US citizens short. We will recover, just as they did during the depression. If anything we'll get to see a snapshot of the future as gas prices head towards $7/gallon. Life will go on, just differently. If the middle east takes a header, and everything collapses, we wil be fine, but the power brokers obviously won't be.

The reason behind synchronous menstruation is that women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way.\nMen have an effect too, men's pheromones also affect women's menstrual periods. Women respond to these pheromones by shortening their periods and having them more regularly. This was noted among women who had lengthy cycles pre-marriage and once they got married their menstrual cycles became shorter and regular.
Because the closer to the center of mass you are, the mass in this case being the planet, the stronger the gravity. Knowing that, you can imagine how there are gravity gradients surrounding the earth, and it is natural for energy to return to its lowest state, in the case of mass, its lowest state of energy without changing state woud be to locate its self in a position with the lowest potential.\n\nThe location with the lowest potential is the location closest to the center of mass, and given enough time, and the planets have had plenty, the potential will be equally distributed amoung all matter, which results in a circle...\n\nSame as a water droplet in zero gravity.
How long does the speech need to be? You should be able to write something up fairly easily if you have any business background. Customers are the cornerstone of virtually any business. Perhaps you should start with a quotation of some sort that summarizes customer appreciation and go from there. Google for quote sites and then type in "customer appreciation." Pick a quote that has meaning for you and then build something around it. Think about your audience...and gear the speech toward them. There is no one size fits all speech...the best ones come from your heart (but are edited with your mind).

God proves his existance every day when I wake up. I literally should have died a couple of years ago and was almost there but God obviously decided to let me live. I myself do not need anymore proof. Anyone who requires proof has only to look around them to see all that God does and gives.I personally believe that if you need proof of his existence in the form of some Miracle of sorts, then you must first ask yourself what kind of miracle would appease you. I am sure that everyone has a different litmus test they would require for proof. What one person would accept, another person would not. Therefore it is pointless for God to try to prove to you that he exists. That is why he left it up to you as an individual to believe or disbelieve.

Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/global%20warming ). It is mostly man-made and comes from everything from factories to cars. (http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpoglobalwarming.html )Almost every single real scientific study links global warming directly to humans.\n\nIt's only certain political figures that don't want to change for reasons easily guessable. That is why the whole developed world signed that Kyoto Treaty and why every single developed country is working to reduce their polluting of the air, water, and land. \n\nSee the new Gore movie, it has the backing of the scientific AND POLITICAL groups: \n\nScientific community: http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...\n\nGovernment Groups:\n\nNOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) on why Peer-Reviewed Journals are the only real scientific studies to be believed: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwar...\n\nThe EPA's site for KIDS: http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/kids/in...\n\nFrom NASA:\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/library...\n\nThe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is an important part of the U.S. Department of Energy's strategy to understand global climate change:\nhttp://education.arm.gov/studyhall/warmi...\n\nhttp://globalchange.gov/\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/climate.s...\nhttp://marine.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/locator?s...\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environmen...\nhttp://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html\n\nAll of the above are .gov sites.\n\nEdit: \n\nNotice how the person below me offers no evidence what-so-ever. That is exactly what is holding us back in taking real steps in fixing this very easily fixable problem. All people like this due is try to poke holes in something that is already rock-solid in ALL REAL SCIENTIFIC (GOVERNMENT) COMMUNITIES. Hollywood, Gore, or anyone else who has made this up. It is our own government organizations, working separately, that have all come to the same conclusion. The people who don't believe offer nothing but opinions and fake studies done by non-governmental - or none-peer reviews - organizations.\n\nIt is a real problem that can be fixed with easy measures.
To find a good, basic violin, search eBay under antique or vintage violins......Look for the Strad copies from around 188--1910.....These are mass-produced German/Czech violins, the type that our grandmothers or great-grandmothers ordered from Sears Roebuck and Wards mail order catalog......They will run from $100 to $300, depending upon age and condition. When these types of violins are fitted with a low bridge, they usually have a very good bright tone, with good sustain, and because of the wear and age, are easy to play. Find a bow with some age on it, eBay, fleamarket, etc., preferably a Glasser horsehair bow. With these two items combined, you should have a violin set that sounds good, and is easy to play.......very, very important when you are beginning to learn......The best fiddle players I've heard are self-taught......I've found a lot of instructors just have too much ego going with an adult player, and sometimes it's better to grasp at a few basics own your own. I have played and built violins for over 20 years. Good luck to you.

I'm on my third pack of Seasonale and I really like it. I too have oily skin and that hasn't changed. No birth control pill I've ever been on has cleared up the oil. You might break out less, but the oil will stay. My skin cleared up when I moved to Wyoming, but that might not be practical for you. If your skin is breaking out due to hormones then Seasonale should be great for you since, you'll only experience those hormones every three months. Seasonale really helped one of my girlfriends with her hormone induced migraines. Also, Seasonale is not a new type of birth control. It's a regular birth control pill. Doctors have been prescribing birth control in this exact manner for years. Seasonale is just the first company to actually market the product and put it in it's snazzy little case with all three months together. Good Luck, hope you like it.\n\nHow often do you wash your face and what do you use? You might actually be making your skin oily by washing it too often with a harsh oil stripping product. \n\nUse an oil free product, but it doesn't necessarily have to be for oily skin. I like Purpose face wash and occasionally use their moisturizer. Aveeno Positively Radiant face wash is also really good. I also keep Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths in my purse. I stopped using Purpose when I moved to Wyoming since the air here is so dry and of the three products Purpose is the most drying. I keep it around though for when I travel.\n\nAll of these products are readily available and not very expensive. Also, I tried all of these products at my dermatologists suggestion. She has also recommended different Neutrogena products but I only use their sunscreen. I really like the oil absorbing sheets, it doesn't matter what brand you buy they all work well.

I dont know why people are racist. It's just been an ongoing thing that has happened since eternity. If you asked me, I think it's absolutely stupid, as well as ignorant. Theirs this whole mentality, in which people believe their superior to other races, but in reality we're all the same people. The only thing that's different is our skin color, and our cultures. But deep down, you have the rebel person from a culture, that relates to another rebel in a different culture, you have the preppy person that relates to another preppy person in a different culture, you have the shy kid from a culture that can relate to another kid in a different culture. To sum things up, WE'RE ALL THE SAME, no matter what. I just wish people would take those topics into consideration, and just realize that we are the same people, and leave behind the fact of wanting to put others down, or block their successes just because of their races.

Given:\na = b = c\n\nEquation:\n2a^2 + b(c*4) = 24\n\nSo:\n2a^2 + a(a*4) = 24\n2a^2 + 4a^2 = 24\n6a^2 = 24\na^2 = 4\nsqrt(a^2) = sqrt(4)\na = sqrt(4)\na = -2 or 2\n\nThe answer is a, b and c are all -2 or 2\n\nTo confirm try it out:\n2(2^2) + 2(2x4) = 24\n2(4) + 2(8) = 24\n8 + 16 = 24 \n24 = 24, \nSo a,b,c = 2 is one answer\n\n2(-2)^2 + -2(-2x4) = 24\n2(4) + -2(-8) = 24\n8 + 16 = 24 \n24 = 24, so a,b,c = -2 is another answer\n\nIt is important to remember that sqrt of 4 is either -2 or 2.

Finally, it appears that the danny boy submitted to religious pressure and exonerated every such person.

Not only was I tempted to, but I fell into it. And hopefully you can learn from my passed sin . IT'S NOT WORTH IT !!!! When we get tempted,we are blinded to all the consequences that follow. And believe me, there will be consequences .. but here is the good news.. Being tempted is not a sin .. resist the devil and he will flee from you . trust me, you will be greatly disappointed in the end,with unbelievable heartache . \nIt is the Christians duty to cast down those imaginations that exault themselves above God and bring them into the obedience and captivity of Jesus .. Shut the thoughts down, and replace them with God's word .. Lord Bless you ....\n\nemotional closeness can very well lead to physical . The devil knows how to set that up like nobodies business . he will do what ever he can to acomplish his goal .
There are many supplements and techniques that are good for this issue. There are also medications, but those have side effects. \n\nNatural Supplement - " 5-HTP 200mg", which is a serotonin precursor. \n\nA low serotonin level has been linked to PE, that is why doctors prescribed anti-depressants, \n5-HTP will boost the serotonin levels naturally. \n\nIn general, practise and relaxation is all that is necessary to deal with this problem. Most men can gain better control by learning the "start-stop" or "squeeze" techniques.\n\nStop and Start method: This involves sexual stimulation until the man recognizes that he is about to ejaculate; the stimulation is then removed for about 30 seconds and then may be resumed. The sequence is repeated until ejaculation is desired.\n\nSqueeze method: This involves sexual stimulation until the man recognizes that he is about to ejaculate; at that point, the man or his partner firmly squeezes the end of the penis (where the tip meets the shaft) for several seconds, withholding further sexual stimulation for about 30 seconds, and then resuming stimulation.
Spirituality has a couple of different meanings. One involves non-material beings, in which I don't believe. The other simply expresses an amazement with the universe around us and ways to learn how to love and help others. This I strongly believe in. Since many religions ask and try to answer the second type of question, I have found it useful to look at the answers they have come up with to see if I can use them in my life. Not all of the answers require belief in a deity. Also, given the number of religios people around, it is important (to me) to understand the various religions so I can relate better to those I share this planet with. When I disgree, I *try* to do so politely unless impoliteness started somewhere else.

Gandhi was a spritual leader who other leaders of the world like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. got their ideas from with the nonviolent protest. People around the world was inspired by his work that they want to take that non-violent acts into their own community/country. I guess Gandhi was an inspirational leader too.

Attention is what will matter the most. Actions speak louder than words so anything you can do that will make him feel special. Call him on the phone just to say hi as many times as you can. Tell him how much you love him and how sorry you are that you took your frustrations out on him. Tell him he is so special to you and you couldn't imagine going on without him. If he loves you back he will understand. good luck
First let me say that I'm so sorry for the turmoil that is inside you. Love has no age, it's in the heart. However, you have children to consider. It's difficult to step back from a situation that consumes you. You have to ask yourself this question -- are you in love with this young woman, or are you swept away by the attention, devotion, respect, sex, etc. that you may be receiving from her? Does this young woman truly love you, or are you a wise, older, father figure for her? In ten years, will she have outgrown you and look for a younger man? Will you be hurt? She doesn't share the same wisdom and life experiences that you have. She has her entire life ahead of her. I'm not trying to negate your feelings, just am trying to tell you to look at it from all views. Another thing, show your wife the respect she deserves. She's the mother of your children and deserves your respect for that alone. Would she consider counseling? Is there anything left to salvage? Is there resentment or other issues that is the reason for the lack of sex? I would suggest that you slow down, do some serious evaluating of your own life, and perhaps seek counseling for yourself. Is your self-esteem shot? Please don't do anything rash, but if you both decide that you are truly in love for the long haul -- even when you're 74 and she's 43 -- I wish you happiness. Good luck with whatever you decide.
The Browns offensive line play is nothing short of well offensive and the season is gone but much has to do with injuries as well as departures...Crennel does realize the situation for it gets played out every week in front of him...I believe that the situation will be corrected even as he is a defensive guy he knows both sides of the ball depend on the guy in the trenches so correction will be coming in seasons like this, this period is like an extra pre-season the guys are playing for next year those that are not giving 100% wont be around long.have looked at the lines stats and really just a couple weak links and it only takes one for the break...not a brown fan myself cant wait to see them back on their feet ready for the dog bones and terrible towels to get back to good old nasty days in the trenches

i personally think hulk and superman would be pretty even if hulk was very very mad other then superman would be faster and have some extra abilities. But with a symbiote any of them not nessaraly the venom one althought. The symbiote would increase hulks strenght and also make him not just mad but crazy and mad. He would be unstopable. I don't think anything short of galactus or some other super omnipitant being would be able to stop him.

The important thing when dealing with paying off your old debt is to be CERTAIN that any negative report is removed from your credit history. Just saying it's "paid in full" means nothing when it also says it was in collections or late payments.\n\nBefore you pay a dime on you debt, be sure the creditor agrees IN WRITING to remove the listing from your history. Once they have your money it's not likely they will work with you.\n\nBy the way, if the creditor tells you it's illegal for them to do it, they are lying. Read the Fair Credit Reporting act, and the Fair and Accurate Reporting Act. There is noting in there preventing a creditor from removing their listings!

i swear to God , its cuz of all the lesbian porn that are around....!\nthey watch it and they ACTUALLY think that its the same in real life.....\ntry putting a stone butch making love to a lipstick femme , i think they'd head for the nearest exit (no offence butches, love you guys but i need to make a point) because they are soo used to what the adult film industry or rather their own male ego and chauvanism tell them....women are created to pleasure my d!ck and the world revolves around it! so the idea of "lesbians" having sex with them is stroking (pardon the pun) their egos. ie: they are so good in bed that even lesbians will make an exeption for it\n\nanything that threathens their male supremacy is a turn-of. so this explains them not wanting to watch two guys make out.... hence explaning the stone butch situation too. butches are a threat to their ego, so it will not be tolerated...\nas for why do they like to watch it, i think if you cant get the real thing..... stimulation would do just fine.... lol\n\nhope this makes sense
it depends on which motherboard is in it and which model. the fastest that type of board would be upgradable to is 200, 233, or 266 depending the board. 233 was the highest pentium chip made, if it will take cyrix chips, then 266. go to Ibm support and seartch for your model, it will probably still have the spec for yours in aptiva support

In Dentistry, we try to save a tooth if possible. Extraction is the last resort (if a patient is willing to try other routes, as you have done). Sometimes, even with the best Dentist and the best intentions, a tooth is nonrestorable. Ideally, you should have had a crown on this tooth right after the root canal, (was this done/recommended) this is a way to avoid loosing more strucure. If a tooth is broken or decayed below the gum line it typically cant be saved. I cant say for sure what I would do if you were my patient as I do not know the entire history and cant see your tooth. If you fear you are being told this because for some reason this dentist can't fix your tooth or just doesnt want to for some reason, I would recommend a second opinion. Find a friend who is happy with their dentist and make an appointment for a consultation regarding this tooth. GOOD LUCK!

There are three main types of juices - citrus juicers, centrifugal juicers, and masticating juicers.\n\nThe citrus juicers are for citrus only - oranges, grapefruits and the like.\n\nMost juicers are probably the centrifugal type - they have an internal basket that goes around in a circle. These types are good for carrots, apples, etc.\n\nThe third type is generally considered the best - the masticating juicers. These juicers more or less "chew" up the vegetables and they produce more juice of better quality than the centrifugal - 24 ounces more juice per 10 pounds of carrots. \n\nThe Breville juicers are very high end centrifugal juicers and cost around $200 to $400. (800JEXL) They have a wide mouth that will fit an entire apple without cutting it first. I used a Waring JEX328 for more than two years and it worked very well for me at a much cheaper price - around $60.\n\nI recently bought a Champion 2000+ juicer, and I like it much better than the Waring juicer, and I liked the Waring juicer a lot. The Champion juicer is a masticating juicer and runs around $250. One of the nice features is that the pulp comes out the end of the tube, so you can set a large bowl there to collect it and can easily dump it and continue juicing. It's also easier to clean.\n\nI mostly juice carrots and similar vegetables. I've heard other juicers work better for wheat grass. You can also buy an attachment for the champion juicer to make nut butters and even to make flour from grains; however, if that is your primary purpose, there might be a better specialized machine.\n\nIn summary, if budget allows, I would recommend a champion juicer, and if you are on a tight budget, i would recommend the Waring centrifugal juicer.

For the past 17 years, I have worked in IT, the first 7 developing software and the past 10 testing software and websites. What I learned at University was essential to my career today as I learned how to learn what I needed to know to do whatever job I need to do.\n\nThere are only a lucky few people, who end up staying in the career fields they started out in.

I feel like i just answered this question an hour ago. Hehe. Okay. I know this sounds very weird, but it has helped me examine a lot in my life. It may or may not work for you, but there's always room to try, isn't there. First off, question everything!!! Why are you crying? Okay, you've answered that it's about something that's going to happen or "something else". You need to be more specific. Find the answers. Ask yourself questions until you tire of it or find the answers to them. You are more than likely having a bout of insomnia, as I am one. True, you can just let your body tire itself out. Things that you can do to help this are:\n\n1) exercise\n2) meditate (listen to soft music, breathing exercises, etc)\n3) taking a bath\n4) reading \n\nWhile you are trying to go to sleep it's best to clear your mind, hence why i suggest meditation. This is a big problem for most of us as we have so much going on in our lives and why we feel we didn't sleep as well the next day. Clear your mind of all your problems, worries and anxieties. Let yourself go and drift. You will fall asleep.
Its equivalent to proving\nm*n = (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) )\n\nNow, i'll have to use basic number theory. The idea is to show that the number of times a prime factor of m*n occurs on the LHS is equal to the number of times a prime factor of (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ) occurs on the RHS.\nNote : LHS = Left Hand Side\n RHS = Right Hand Side\n\nFor any prime factor p of m*n, call it p. Now say p occurs to the power of h in m and power of k in n. That is to say m "contains" p^h while n contains p^k. Note that h,k are nonnegative integers. \n\nNow, in lcm(m,n), we would choose p^ [ min(h,k) ] while\nin gcd(m,n) we would choose p^ [ max(h,k) ] \nNote that min (h,k) means minimum of h and k, similarly max (h,k)means maximum of h and k . For example, if h=2 and k=3, then min (2,3) = 2. while max(2,3) = 3. If say h = k, then obviously in both lcm and gcd of m*n we choose p^h to be in its product. This is true for EVERY prime factor of m*n.\n\nSo, consider the product (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ).\nFor EACH prime factor p of m*n, we have shown above that it occurs as { p^ [ min(h,k) ] } * { p^ [ max(h,k) ] }, that is our RHS product contains \n p^ [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = p^(h+k)\nNow, in our LHS, p occurs as p^h * p^k = p^(h+k) too!!!\nThus, we have shown for each prime factor, p of m*n, it occurs as the same product in both the LHS and RHS. And thus\nwe have LHS = RHS. Done.\n\nOne question may circle in your mind, that is how i know that [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = (h+k)\nWell, this is a fact.\n\nFurther, if you want to show it, consider 3 cases.\n\nCase 1. ( h = k)\nHere min(h,k) = min(h,h) = h\nand max(h,k) = max(h,h) = h\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = h + h = 2h.\nAnd (h+k)= h + h = 2h.\n\nCase 2. ( h < k)\nHere min(h,k) = h, because h is smaller.\nand max(h,k) = k, because k is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = h + k \n\nCase 3. ( h > k )\nHere min(h,k) = k, because k is smaller.\nand max(h,k) = h, because h is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) + max(h,k) ] = k + h

There are hundreds of different types of rashes, and even more possibly causes. It could be a symptom of something else, or it could be a disease all its own.

See a doctor.\n\nI assume you mean the drug cetirizine, which is the antihistamine commonly known as Zyrtec. Many people, myself included, use antihistamines daily on a long term basis, without any ill effect.

Depends if you are asking about carpets or actual steam cleaning as used in industry. Since you didn't say which I will answer both.\n\n1. Carpets. Does not use steam but very hot water mixed with a solvent or detergent. It uses pressure to make sure the solution penetrates deep and then vacuums the solution and removed dirt and hopefully grease into a holding tank for disposal. A much cheaper and slightly more effective mixture than commercial cleaning fluids is real lemon juice. The various acids naturally in lemon are a very effective grease cutter and also act as a fabric brightner. Use the same amount as you would commericial cleaner. (It can be used pure in a squirt bottle to degrease a dirty engine. Spray on wait (the time it takes to spray should be long enough) and rinse or spray off. I suggest spraying off with the same bottle. That you won't get the wires wet and need to wait before starting the car.\n\n2. Industry. Actually does steam and requires the user to wear a heat and waterproof suit. The high temperature and presurre very effectively removes dirt and grease. Usually it is used on machines heavily caked with grease.\n\nHope this helps

Wild Turkeys live in open woodlands and forests with lots of clearings and meadows. They travel during the day looking for food.\n\nWild Turkeys eat a great variety of foods, including: insects, spiders, snails, slugs, salamanders, small lizards, small frogs, millipedes, grasshoppers, very small snakes, worms, grasses, vines, flowers, acorns, buds, seeds, fruits, clovers, dogwood, blueberries, cherries, hickory nuts, beechnuts, and other vegetation.\n\nWild Turkeys travel in small flocks. For most of the year, they are single-sex flocks. Females are with females, males with males. Young turkeys follow their mothers.\n\nWild Turkeys have good eyesight and hearing, and they are very fast runners.\n\nThe breeding season is in March and April. A male turkey will try to find a female flock to make his harem.\n\nTo attract females, the male will gobble and strut, fanning out his tail. He will mate with several females in the flock.\n\nWild Turkey nests are made in the ground. A shallow depression is lined with leaves and covered up with vines and other plants. Ten to fifteen eggs are laid. Eggs are light brown, with black and dark brown spots. The female will sit on the eggs for a month are more. This makes her very vulnerable to predators.

There are two or three kinds of cheaters. The worst kind, and I know several, are the immature selfish type who seem to need to prove to themselves over and over that they "still have it" or somehting like that. Then there is the guy who loses it once or twice. Men who travel a lot, and women, get very lonely at night. Hard to describe but I've been there. The porn industry makes a killing by selling all kinds of adult programs to hotel travellers. They really miss home ... the wrong situation, the wrong time, perhaps there was an angry exchange with the wife ... some hot babe walks into the bar and sits next to him ... it happens. \n\nThe third kind is the guy or woman who has been in a loveless marriage for years. There is a nice house, kids, community life and all kinds of great things that came from the marriage. But somewhere along the way the romance died. Husbands and wives spend so much time battling over emotional territory, work so hard to get what they want out of the marriage ... lots of wives offer sex as a reward for good behavior. It seems to work so well that they never give it away for free, lest they lose that leverage. Husbands may in turn stop doing anything unless they get a reward for it. Sick, I know, but those of you who've been married for a long while know what I'm talking about. The husband or wife who "cheats" on that marriage is usually desperate for genuine intimacy. Love that doesn't require a high score on the report card. The women who use the vagina as a wrench aren't terribly happy, either, and are just as likely to be seduced into the "cheat."\n\nIt is a sad state of affairs. Unfortunately, the young immature guy or gal who cheats early on for selfish reasons pretty much destroys the trust needed to find real intimacy. He or she will wind up at an early age in the third kind of loveless marriage. \n\nThe key, I think, is to never use sex for leverage. Never!!! It is a shared intimacy that only the two can share. If you want a new car or tennis bracelet, just ask. Amaze him with your passion and give him a place of emotional refuge at home. He will be so grateful that he'll bring home gifts on his own. Those are the best kind.
Lady_Chris is correct. Bankruptcy is federal law. While some portions of the process etc vary from state to state - the bulk of it is the same regardless of where it was filed.\n\nYou will have to have the approval of the trustee to obtain ANY new debt until your chapter 13 is completely over.\n\nThe validity of any debt made during this time is very questionable. And VERY frowned upon by the attorney, the trustee and the bankruptcy court & judge. Even a secured credit card as someone mentioned. The thought process I believe leans toward "if you can take on another debt - you could instead be paying more on the chapter 13 plan". That would certainly be my argument should I have a customer in a chapter 13 that obtained a new debt without approval. Not a smart thing to do (without trustee approval).\n\nTalk to your attorney should you be interested in pursuing. Time frames vary from place to place - but here the norm is that it might take a few months to get an answer back to your request to take on another debt.\n\nThe Chapter 13 stays on your credit report I believe for 10 years now, while a chapter 7 stays for only 7 ( I think ). \n\nIf your attorney is not providing the advice / service you need - you can call the trustee directly and ask about having a different attorney assigned to you (might be added cost). There have been times I have seen customers change attornies for one reason or another.\n\nGood luck.

Every UCLA alumnus should call the UCLA President's office (310-825-4321) and let Pres. Robert C. Dynes and Chancellor Norman Abrams know that you will withhold all contributions until the police officers are fired. \n\nA university is usually far more tolerant and respectful of students' rights, and far more restrictive on police brutality, than outside the university gates. In Mexico, police are not even allowed inside a university gates unless specifically invited in by the Chancellor. Having worked in universities for the past 20 years, I can safely say the behavior of the UCLA PD as exhivited in the 6-minute video (not 10 seconds) is inexcusable. They could have dragged the guy out, let him scream all he wants. If he resisted phsycially, they could have handcuffed him -- for 200 years our police did not need tasers or pepper spray to handcuff people. (Maybe he was already handcuffed when they Tasered him, which is even less excusable.) \n\nThere is a big difference between being tased once (often by a low-voltage) in a test situation and having it done to you multiple times in a row in a hostile situation. There have been 73 deaths associated with tasers between 1999 and 2004. Even police officers in five states have sued Taser International claiming they "suffered serious injuries after being shocked with the device during training classes." http://orlando.injuryboard.com/defective-products/an-alternative-to-the-defective-and-deadly-taser.php
Well first of all, that is not a question, it is a statement. Yet I am going to assume that you are trying to say "How can you save money?" and will answer that question. I'm sure you have heard of saving 10% of every paycheck and put it into long-term saings. This is the most important concept in investing and savings. Yet for most people it is impossible to find space in their budgets. The only way for many people that this works is to put the money directly into a CD (certificate of deposit - a type of bank account). This way it is not at all tempting to spend it when you get it. There is a way to get this done automaticaly, yet I don't really know how (I am 15). \n\nAll of this is explained in the book "The Wealthy Barber" by David Chilton. If you were to only read one book in your life, this one is the one you should read. It goes through basic savings and investment skills while putting it in a way that is entertaining and simple to understand. Everyone should read this book and everyone can accieve a happy retirement if they follow the advice put forth by Dave. It is amazing how simple the suggestions that he says are to implement.
The Story of Lilith is this - that she was created just as Adam, directly of the breath of God - not from Adam's side as was Eve. In some accounts she rejects Adam because he does not respect her as an equal. The idea that she is banished is incorrect - she calls out Gods name to repel Adam as she struggles with him and he is stunned by the power of that name, then she leaves Eden because she is filled with fury and anger towards Adam. \n\nNote that Lilith and all her descendents are therefore free of the "original sin" of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and are -not- banished from the garden.\n\nEventually Adam complains to God that he is lonely - in response to the prayer of Adam, God sends out angels to grant his prayers. The angels attempt ask Lilith to return but She refuses. Since God has given her free-will, the angels are forbidden to interfere with her decision but they must do as God has commanded them. As she rests in the waters of the sea, the angels cause her to give birth to 100 children each day, (perhaps this was an alternate solution? an attempt to alleviate Adam's loneliness?). She elects to kill her own children out of spite, and in frustration the angels place curses upon her saying she must kill all her children until she returns. If she was to return to Eden the curse would be broken. One angel attempted to break her resistance by hiding some of her children - transforming them into monsters so she does not recognize them, for this reason Lilith is called the mother of demons, djinn, witches, etc.

1 pt = 2 cups = 16 oz.\n\nSo you just need to convert everything into ounces:\n\n1 pt 9 fl oz = 16 + 9 = 25 oz.\n2 pt 10 fl oz = 2 * 16 + 10 = 42 oz.\n\n3 qt = 6 pts = 12 cups = 96 oz.\n\n96 - 25 - 42 = 29 oz.\n\n29 oz. = 16 + 13 = 1 pt 13 oz.

No, wrong... "por" means times, as in 2x4=8 (Dos POR cuatro IGUAL ocho)\n\nson/as I dont understand, the basic math funcions are:\n- (menos) minus\n+ (mas) plus\nx (Por) times \n/ (Dividido) divided by\n\na thing that can be is "sen" (seno) instead of "son" and means sinus. if i am in the correct line "AS" then is arcoseno and means "Arcsin".\n\nand y means either an incognit, such as in 2x+3y=4 or the simple and plain "and" of spanish language
The biomedical importance of the process of diffusion through a colloidal medium is that it a means of passive transport in cells, that means there is no energy expenditure in the transport of matter from higher to lower concentration or from higher to lower concentration.\n\nFollowing should explain things to you...\n\n\nThe cell will gain water and grow larger. In plant cells, the central vacuoles will fill and the plant becomes stiff and rigid, the cell wall keeps the plant from bursting\n\nIn animal cells, the cell may be in danger of bursting, organelles called CONTRACTILE VACUOLES will pump water out of the cell to prevent this. \n\n\nIn plant cells, the central vacuole loses water and the cells shrink, causing wilting.\n\nIn animal cells, the cells also shrink.\n\nIn both cases, the cell may die.\n\nThis is why it is dangerous to drink sea water - its a myth that drinking sea water will cause you to go insane, but people marooned at sea will speed up dehydration (and death) by drinking sea water. \n\nThis is also why "salting fields" was a common tactic during war, it would kill the crops in the field, thus causing food shortages.
Most problems in this world are created by people who want to prove that their religion or their country or their economic ideology is better than others.\nReligion is not about 'my dad can beat up your dad!' it is quite opposite. Those who want to prove that their religion is superior don't know the first thing about religion.\nOrganized religions should try to be servants of humanity, not masters.\nChristians say their massiah was God's only son; Jews say they are God's chosen people; Muslims say that their prophet was God's last prophet and all in thier Holy book is the final deal...I am sure Hindus and Buddhists also have some way or other to claim superiority....its all bovine excreta...\nJust refuse to accept superiority of any organized religion over rest of humaniry...

The great thing about America is that laws can be changed to reflect evolving societal standards. That's why there are Amendments to our Constitution.\n\nRemember that the 18th Amendment made sale and transport of "intoxicating liquors" -unconstitutional- in 1919. It was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, thus making liquor sale and transport -constitutional-, once again.\n\nOf course, making a student-led prayer at school functions constitutional would require "an act of Congress", both literally and figuratively..but it could happen.\n\nNote that if Congress wants to reenact a law the Supreme Court has found unconstitutional, they can try to amend the Constitution — no easy feat, since an Amendment must be passed by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House, and then voted on by the states.\n\nEven the Supreme Court has reversed decisions. Why do you think there's all the hoopla about a new conservative bent in the high court? The fear that Roe vs. Wade will be reversed is on the mind of every pro-choice individual in the country.\n\nLaws are constantly being re-interpreted or changed.

This is when the supreme court ruled that "separate but equal" facilities were permissible under the constitution. The ruling held that segregation (for example, separate bathroom facilities etc. for "Colored" and "White" people) was allowed in the US.\n\nThis was overruled about 60 years later, though, by the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Here, they ruled that segregation in America would NOT be tolerated. For specific case details, search the Internet for "Plessy v Ferguson" or "Brown v Board of Education."
We didn't evolve from monkies... Humans and Monkies/Apes... Evolved from a common ancestor... Its a bit more complex then how I am putting it but trying to give the general idea... Our common ancestor given different enviromental conditions and different places it was located had different traits that the enviroment selected for... Some died... some lived... over time we get a number of different species, us being one, monkies and apes being other forms...

Call dentists and ask to fax then a short interview question sheet. Ask them questions about the product, their experiences, preferences, etc.\n\nThe reason Captek is so great is becase it uses gold under porcelain instead of a metal alloy. \n\nTeeth appear to be a certain color because of many things. Some light reflects off of the outer layer of the tooth (enamal in natural or porcelian in a restorative crown). Some light goes into the tooth and bounces back off the dentin or metal under the outer layer. Some light goes all the way through the tooth (in a natural or all porcelian crown only!). \n\nIn a metal substructure, the light that hits the metal and bounces back gives a dark gray tint to the tooth. In capteck, the gold gives it a yellowish tint which is more normal for teeth.\n\nAny crown can match the srounding teeth if enough time and talent is used in selecting the colors. Just like mixing paint, a little tint can change the entire color of the final product. The dental team must select the correct outer porcelian color that will result in the correct tint after the light from the substructure has reflected through it. If the outer color matches exactly, then the final product will not because of the substructure. Also, the color and type of light makes a huge difference. Floresent lights makes the colors look different. Special bulbs called daylight lights should be used during color selection - or natural sunlight!\n\nThere are many reasurch companies who are similiar to comsumer reports. Call your local dental supplier: Sullivan Schein, Burkhart dental supply, patterson, JB dental, or a dental labratory. Ask them for articles and studies on those products.

Every-ones boiling point is different. And neither counseling nor cutting yourself may or may not work for you or the next guy. Life is one big mystery, for a lot of people. Trying to find the balance in your life of what makes you Happy. Maybe just the right person is needed in your life to make you happy or a person in your life is making you miserable. To find happiness I believe that you are the only one who can decide what truly will bring happiness and a healthy life. One thing I do notice is people who are inactive may or may not be overweight, tend to be depressed. Try finding activities that either relax your state of mind or just bring you happinesss for whatever reason. Each person is so unique, therefor there is not one recipe to happines!

Do the following:\n1) Break up exam study sessions into chunks less than 2 hours each. \n2) Study one topic at a time and make yourself a good schedule and stick to it.\n3) Between sessions, take a 10-15 minute break to relax or do something you like.\n4) Make sure you get 8 hours of sleep a night and take sleep aids if you have to\n5) Avoid stimulants like coffee and cigarettes. Instead, eat healthy things like herbs, fruits, and fiber. They will give your body real mental and physical power. Also do a bit of exercise.\n\nIt may seem like taking care of your body is the last thing you have time for, but I promise it will reenergize you and help you study and remember better.
Yes. Water baptism is only a symbolic gesture, even if you believe it to be a very important part in a Christian's life or not, it's ultimately only symbolic. As far as works, these are an expression of Christ's love through a Christian to others, not something that can be done to gain entrance to heaven. The Bible only cites that belief in Jesus is the only requirement for eternal life.\n\nAnd I'm 23, not quite a teenager anymore, but still young enough. :)

The same thing happened to me, however, the answer is pretty much one thing. Your presence was required. She needed and wanted you there to be there for her on a daily basis. I know the whole ordeal and situation with money, but just as money can't buy you love, you can't survive without money. Unfortunately, the presence of a person on a daily basis is really and very important, and I think she's hurt because neither one of you two has managed to be together for about 8 years and that's a long time. It's not your fault and it's not her fault, but why so long is a good question to ask. \n\nThis is what distance and time apart does to people. Sometimes people have too much time to think and their imagination runs wild. She is angry, but more at the separation and distance than at you. Everything has a time and place and in her own way she is saying and telling you that you can't deal with the pain of being apart so long and any longer. Once again, it's not your fault, it's just the way things are when two people are apart for such a long time. The bottom line is and was that your presence was required and you couldn't be there for economic reasons. Trust me, love doesn't care about money. \n\nYou didn't hurt her, but she was definitely hurt by your absence. It is just another way of saying that she really, really missed you. Unfortunately, people can only wait so long to have somebody at their side regardless of how responsible and caring you might have been at a distance. I know it's hard and it doesn't make sense, but keep in mind that she is blaming you for not being there for her when she physically needed your presence. Remember, it's not your fault, but those are some of the consequences of time apart and distance.
If it has a Sturmey Archer rear hub on the wheel, especially a 3-speed, the date will be printed on the hub. \n\nSee www.sheldonbrown.com for more information about this type of bike. \nAlso, there are several Western Flyer collectors on the web. \n\nSome of the Western Flyer are commuter grade and some are less. Rarely, there are a few very stylish cruisers in the Western Flyer brand, so those are worth more. The higher value models are almost all 3 speed, with a few derailleur based. The lower value models are almost all single speed. \nThe rare exception is one or two outrageously styled single speed cruisers that were made in the 50's. Those are also valuable, but without the date on the hub, you'll have to look at classic collector's websites.\nNot matter what date, the more outrageous the styling, the higher the value of the Western Flyer bikes. \n\nBut, I'm saying, check and see if it is a 3 speed, and if so, just read the date right off the rear hub. ;)

For example, three rooms (1/3, 2/3 and 3/3's done for 6 parts of 9 parts, etc. What can be excluded from your calculations; 70% complete except for landscaping? Importantly, who are you making the completion estimate for and what is their major concern (budget? time?). Good luck!
I do not believe in a god or any higher power. I believe that we are alone here and there is nothing out there that can guide or help us.\n\nThat may sound depressing or lonely, but for me it is a very freeing feeling. I know that everything I do, I do for myself and others. I do not answer to some power in the sky. \n\nI also believe that we are nothing more than the most advanced lifeform on earth (in most ways). We can think, love and have feelings. Because of our advanced minds, we created gods to answer things we did not yet understand.\n\nBecause we are nothing more than an advanced makeup of cells put together to make a human, when we die, everything we are dies. There is no soul. We do not go anywhere after death. The only way to have a so-called afterlife is to do good on earth and have people care for and love you and remember you when you die. \n\nAs long as we do everything during our lives to make it better for ourselves and everyone else, we will die happily.

You need to prove your genealogy back to a person who is on the final rolls of the tribe.\n\nYou need to get your birth certificate, then your parents' birth certificates, then your grand-parents', and so on until you get back to your tribal member ancestor. \n\nBefore 1900 or so, there were very few birth certificates kept. They were not required. You can get baptismal records or census records instead.\n\nYou can get both census records, and all of the final tribal rolls at the National Archives and records Administration (NARA) Go to www.nara.gov for info.\n\nWith all of this, you are now eligible to JOIN the tribe. You will need to write to them and request to be enrolled. I suppose that gets you all of the benefits of tribal membership, but you aren't owed any money.

I totally agree with you!\n\nJames 2. 14-17\n\n14. What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? \n\n15. Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. \n\n16. If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? \n\n17. In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

All right, I'm not going to look at what he has done so far this season.... because it's just easier to figure out that way. \n\nHe's played in 2125 games, which would amount to about 14 seasons if he were to play 155 games each year. He's actually in his 18th season, so you got to figure he's basically missed three years of playing time (remember, I'm not counting this season, so he's played 17 complete seasons). \n\nHis home run total coming into the season was 536, which over 14 seasons of playing time averages out to 38 home runs per year. If you take that average over the three seasons that he missed, it would come out to 114. So, theoretically, he should have been at about 650 coming into this season, which with his 12 so far this year would put him at 662, and on pace for about 688 by the end of this season. \n\nHowever, he was at 398 before coming to Cincinnati. In his last four years in Seattle, he was averaging 52 per season. He's in Cincy for his 7th season this year. If he doesn't get injured and even averages 45 HR/season, he'd be looking at 713 at the end of this season.\n\nAs if this isn't way too much already, another way of looking at it - \nHe has averaged 3.7 AB/G, and a 14.68 HRR (home run ratio - the number of AB's between each HR). If he played 155 games per season, he would have 2635 games, and 9750 AB's, which would translate into 664 HR's at the beginning of this season, and 703 at the end of this season.

Sort of like "Nafta Plus" or closer to EU. I'm not sure about that one. If Mexico and/or Canada wanted to join the US, then I would be in favor of that perhaps.\n\nI think the US should be open to expanision, but I think it should be others joining our union not an amagamation. Mexico's government is deeply flawed. Canada's government borders on not being entirely a Democracy- their senate is appointed and representation in their lower house is not proportionate to their population. \n\nAnd opening the south border to Mexicans to come and go is such a crazy idea... that it might just work.

From consumer's side:\nIf you're asked by the goverment to buy a new car and sell your old (which will be hard to sell since noone will buy a car that cannot be used since government restrict the old oil-based car) would you want to do it? Without any doubt? \n\nIf you have a car that you like very much either because it's your only car or because you have a memory with it, are you willing to sell it for a very low price because they can't be run because of "high pollution level"?\n\nWould I sell my car as a rusted old steels?\n\nFrom car manufacturer's side:\nSince government has restricted oil-based car, will I have enough time to design, publicise, make, and mass produce a car that runs on alternative fuels? Will I be able to produce it on a reasonable price because researching the new technology would need cost?\n\nFrom government side:\nWould this shift affect the country's relationship with other countries cause we don't buy their oils anymore? Would this shift worth as much as the cost needed?\n\nFrom fuel producer side:\nWell, the whole country has have gas station for oil, I've made a lot of investment on that, would I buy a whole new gas station kit for alternative fuel for the whole country's gas station that I have? In how many years would that change return me the investment I made, perhaps 100 years? \n\nSo shifting quickly brings more bad effect than good effect, there should be a transition phase such that:\nFully oil using ->\nSelf decision on using alt fuel ->\nGovernment encouragement ->\nHybrid phase ->\nGovernment Banning of oil based cars

A few simple precautions can reduce the risk of foodborne diseases: \nCOOK meat, poultry and eggs thoroughly. Using a thermometer to measure the internal temperature of meat is a good way to be sure that it is cooked sufficiently to kill bacteria. For example, ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160o F. Eggs should be cooked until the yolk is firm. \nSEPARATE: Don't cross-contaminate one food with another. Avoid cross-contaminating foods by washing hands, utensils, and cutting boards after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry and before they touch another food. Put cooked meat on a clean platter, rather back on one that held the raw meat. \nCHILL: Refrigerate leftovers promptly. Bacteria can grow quickly at room temperature, so refrigerate leftover foods if they are not going to be eaten within 4 hours. Large volumes of food will cool more quickly if they are divided into several shallow containers for refrigeration. \nCLEAN: Wash produce. Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables in running tap water to remove visible dirt and grime. Remove and discard the outermost leaves of a head of lettuce or cabbage. Because bacteria can grow well on the cut surface of fruit or vegetable, be careful not to contaminate these foods while slicing them up on the cutting board, and avoid leaving cut produce at room temperature for many hours. Don't be a source of foodborne illness yourself. Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food. Avoid preparing food for others if you yourself have a diarrheal illness. Changing a baby's diaper while preparing food is a bad idea that can easily spread illness. \nREPORT: Report suspected foodborne illnesses to your local health department. The local public health department is an important part of the food safety system. Often calls from concerned citizens are how outbreaks are first detected. If a public health official contacts you to find our more about an illness you had, your cooperation is important. In public health investigations, it can be as important to talk to healthy people as to ill people. Your cooperation may be needed even if you are not ill.

In Rooster and Dog compability\nThis is not one of the most-favored unions. While you may gain, Rooster, because the Dog is a loyal and loving partner, you worry the Dog to Death with some of your daring maneuvers. Suddenly, you both find it difficult to relax together. You tend peck, and your mate growls and snaps in defense, when you disagree. If you have similar goals, you can gain financially. \nwhile in libra pises compability\nThese two Signs together combine their heads and their hearts to solve all problems -- a winning combination. The best decisions are made with both the emotions and the intellect; this relationship tends to be extremely flexible and progressive. When problems occur, however, the communication breaks down between Libra and Pisces. Libra, who can at times be mentally manipulative, may give Pisces ""the silent treatment."" In this partnership there's always an undercurrent of friction but neither partner will ever truly be the leader. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long. Their only real trouble may result from their tendency to slow down to the point of stopping when they get together.

Undoubtedly one of the hottest areas of debate in discussions between Christians and Muslims is the Christians dogma of the Trinity. Almost invariably, Muslims are convinced that Christians believe in three, separate deities, whilst Christians are adamant in affirming their absolute commitment to monotheism. Without question, the concept of the Triune deity - indeed, the whole doctrine of God - is difficult to understand, but this difficulty is unnecessarily accentuated if an uninformed or incorrect view of Christian dogma is held by Muslims. The purpose of this paper is to set the record straight, and also to compare and contrast aspects of the doctrine of God in both religions.........

The laws vary by state, but, generally, if you openly claim a piece of property as your own, by fencing it, or maintaining it, for a period of time, and nobody challenges you for it, it's yours. In Texas, I believe the time period is 25 yrs. One note, you can't claim adverse possesion against a municipality or govt. agency, or a right of way, over any period of time.
no, that is against the rules

Websites are NOT good places for "free legal advice." The rules of ethics that govern attorneys in the U.S. severely restrict the types of "advice" that may be posted on a website. Attorneys cannot offer "advice" without accepting someone as their client, running a conflict of interest check, and establishing a relationship that allows the attorney to fully understand the issues and facts underlying a person's problem.\n\nIf you just need general information, oftentimes, there will be articles or resources posted by particular institutions or non-profits based on topic area. Need to know about whether a student can sue a teacher for yelling at him in a classroom? Try firstamendmentcenter.org. You get the point. In addition, you can always call your local bar association. They will provide you with a reference for attorneys with areas of knowledge that you may contact. Often, these attorneys may see you at an initial consultation with no fee.

Some like beer, some like wine, some just want a shot of liquor.\n\nIt really depends on your preference. People who love graphical design and likes the MAC interface will prefer MACs. I do admit, I have said in the past I think they are for boys and not Men...but I wasnt being rude about it. I just think the interface is very user friendly and all the features look cartoonish to me. When it comes to PC, they require more hands-on training and they are harder to configure so I think its something men like. Its a low level platform and it takes a person a lot of patience and knowledge to use one....a challenging concept for older generations.\n\nI got used to PCs. Ive had one for more than 10 years now. I used to have a MAC, but I just dont like the interface and the windows architecture on it. I can see why some might like it though. \n\nIts all preference and what youre used to. You wont get any linux users to like MACs....they are two totally different systems. \n\nSome like IE, some like Firefox. Dont you think its all about what they are used to and what they prefer?\n\nIf you ever looked at my past MAC answers, I always answer MAC questions seriously. I never make fun of them, they all serve the same purpose.

As soon as we let them.\n\nWinston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

First, take inventory of what you have and figure out what people ARE buying from you now. Then increase your offerings in those areas and get rid of things that don't sell. If people don't have a lot of money they will still need to buy essential items like food, toilet paper, paper towels, deodorants, toothpaste.... Try and give them options that will allow them the "convenience" of picking up their medicines AND other items they will need. I hope this helps!

agreed. thats like if some other religion made a movie and said "witness the true story" all the christians would be sooo offended. even when i went to opening day of da vince code the movie[just happen to be near the theater] i saw PROTESTERS!! so christians can protest about anything non christian but when someone non-christian protests one of their bible humping movies its considered "disturbing the peace"...or "offending people." what kind of intolerant, double sided bull is that????

Heckling is expected in stand up. This is motivation for comedians to improve their act and get some laughs with a snappy comeback. Richards was acting like a baby who can't take any criticism and he threw a tantrum and his true colors came out. He clearly looks like someone who'd never done this before. Whatever his issues were, he should have reacted to the expected heckling like a normal person; rather than personally attack someone based on race. There are many racists in Hollywood (don't be fooled by the "liberal" branding). A black woman working behind the scenes on "Friends" made a claim that the writers would constantly make racist, anti-black comments and sexist comments regarding the actresses on the show. This is the REAL Hollywood you don't hear much about until incidences like this.
